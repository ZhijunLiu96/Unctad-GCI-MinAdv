About CIREX 
 
What we do  

 

 

 
 

 

              

CIREX is one of the largest steel-casting companies in the world and using the “lost wax” method for 
over 50 years now. With this method, lost wax castings can be produced with a high degree of 
dimensional accuracy and complex shapes. This method also provides engineers with a significant 
degree of product design freedom and choice of materials. Specific desires and requirements can be 
incorporated in the cast pieces. 

Markets 

We have an extensive portfolio of successful projects in the automotive and industrial market 
worldwide. 

Team 

CIREX’s activities are spread across three locations. In addition to the headquarters in the 
Netherlands (NL, Almelo), there are two locations in the Czech Republic (CZ, Koprivnice). Altogether 
approximately 300 persons are employed within our organisation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Mission Statement  

The guiding principle is to unburden our customers completely by being the best development 
partner and producer of complex high-grade steel components – from product development to 
series production. The organisation’s focus is therefore on high product quality, short development 
times (time to market) and a guaranteed low ‘total cost of ownership’. In the long term, this offers 
customers product certainty and excellent delivery reliability for the lowest cost. We continually 
improve our high-tech casting process by continuing to invest in technology, people and company 
processes. Our greatest asset is our group of motivated and highly qualified employees. By daring to 
think out of the box and by always considering whether things can be done “technically better, 
differently, cheaper and/or more simply”, we arrive at the best solution for a competitive price. 

Vision  

Worldwide demand is growing for new, lighter high-tech steel products with complex forms. The rate 
of product development is also accelerating: product cycles are becoming shorter and designs more 
complex. Sustainability is increasingly becoming a design requirement, such that “net shape” 
components are becoming increasingly important. Suppliers are expected to contribute their 
thoughts to the smartest design for a competitive price/quality ratio. This means that, as a supplier 
of complex steel components, we must improve continuously in terms of our organisation,  

                                                                     CIREX – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2016

technology, company and processes. Only in this manner we can continue to satisfy the high 
demands and conditions set by the international market and our stakeholders.  

In this rapidly changing world we can only continue to improve our performance in the appropriate 
manner if we remain loyal to our core values. CIREX takes not only responsibility for the 
circumstances in our own company, but also at her suppliers and other stakeholders. That’s why we 
have joined the UN Global Compact as a participant in March 2016 to emphasise our vision and act 
accordingly. We take our responsibility not to exhaust the world and its natural resources and fully 
respect the human rights of all its inhabitants. 

At CIREX caring for the environment is just as important as the other organisational goals. Our focus 
on the environment is fully implemented in our operational processes. At CIREX, we focus on the 
reuse of raw materials within the process, limiting waste streams, energy management and reducing 
emissions. 

Employees are aware of the importance of working in accordance with the requirements and desires 
of stakeholders and are informed of the relevant legal requirements and regulations.  

Code of Conduct 

In 2016 we have introduced for the first time a Code of Conduct and a Suppliers’ Code of Conduct. 
We support the 10 principles that have been formulated by the UN Global Compact. CIREX has 
officially subscribed to the UN Global Compact in 2016. These 10 principles are the main input for our 
Code of Conduct and accordingly the basis for the business practices of CIREX.  

The Code of Conduct contains the rules, core values and the most important policy principles of our 
company. These rules, values and standards form the common theme throughout our business 
practices and are always applicable.  

The Code of Conduct forms a guideline for directors, management, supervisors and employees for 
acting appropriately within the company and should be complied with at all times so that we can 
continue to be a successful company, prevent incidents and continuously improve ourselves. 
Everybody who enters employment at CIREX must commit 
themselves to the Code of Conduct as part of the introduction 
programme.  

CIREX aims to solely collaborate with external parties and suppliers 
that act in line with the rules, values and standards as stated in the 
Code of Conduct or which at the very least do not conflict with this 
Code of Conduct.  

This Code of Conduct is not just a guideline for our daily actions but 
also a guideline for our relationships with each other and with 
customers, suppliers, stakeholders and our immediate environment.  

Assurance 
 
Every year an ESG-report is drafted by CIREX in addition to this COP. In this comprehensive report all 
main environmental, social and governance aspects are analysed and evaluated. The results from the 
last years are evaluated and new targets are set for the coming years.  

The ESG and COP are used to report to our shareholders and other stakeholders i.e. customers. 
The ESG and COP are published on the company’s Intranet. 

                                                                     CIREX – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2016

Principle 2.   Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses 

Businesses should be support and respect the protection of  

Assessment, policy and targets 

The Human Rights are obvious to us. We respect the Human Rights and will always endorse and 
maintain them.  

Some of the most important Human Rights, but not limited to, are freedom of religion, freedom of 
speech, non-discrimination, a safe and healthy work environment, equal pay for equal work, freedom 
of association and education.  

We owe our success to our people. To hold on to this success we aim to keep the work environment 
a safe place where everybody respects each other, where everybody is equal and where there are 
always good opportunities for personal development.  

CIREX works together with many business partners, located in countries worldwide.  We aim to 
cooperate with partners, suppliers and other stakeholders who support our principles. CIREX and its 
shareholders believe it is important to stimulate good behavior to others by setting the right 
example.      

Assurance  

The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact are included and emphasised in the CIREX Code of 
Conduct. This Code of Conduct is available through our website and handed out to all the employees 
of CIREX. All the employees have to sign the Code of Conduct. By signing the document the employee 
declares he will respect the 10 principles and promises not to act contrary to these principles.  Our 
HR department oversees the principles in our day-to-day behavior and processes.  

We ask our suppliers to declare the raw materials delivered to us are DRC-free (3TG-conflict 
materials, tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold), originating from reliable sources and are in accordance 
with the Dodd-Frank Act.  

Employees can report incidents involving Human Rights to our HR department, supervisor or 
confident. The HR manager reports to the MT in the weekly MT-meeting. Records are kept of all 
incidents.  

Infringements of the rules, violation of laws and regulations and violation of privacy rights are not 
acceptable and will result in disciplinary actions by the management. 
 
Education 
 
CIREX is a certified company for training and education and 
provides internships for students and workplaces for trainees in 
collaboration with educational institutions.  All our facilities and 
production lines can be visited by stakeholders on request. 
Tours for interested parties such as schools are given on a 
regular base.  

                                                                     CIREX – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2016

Open days are organised and we support initiatives to get young people interested in technology and 
science.  

Further developments in technology requires employees are educated well, to ensure we can face 
the challenges in the world of the tomorrow. Being well educated also means job security, job career 
possibilities, satisfaction in work, opportunity to improve yourself and it inspires creativity. We have 
drafted in 2016 a companywide strategic education plan, covering several years, for all employees to 
meet future requirements and to reach a higher level in all aspects of our business.  Additional there 
is a standard annual education plan to meet short term demands. 

Social accountability 

Since many years a partnership exist between CIREX NL and The Twentse Zorgcentra. We provide an 
in-house workspace and learning facility  in a professional work environment for about 15 people 
with mental disabilities or a lasting distance to a regular job position. The participants are supervised 
by employees of the Twentse Zorgcentra. This guarantees meaningful daily activities and improved 
social contacts for the participants. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

We support and encourage various social community activities through sponsorships, active 
involvement by the employees (i.e. volunteers), support of non-governmental organisations, etc.

Joined the UN Global Compact in 2016;  
Introduced a Code of Conduct in 2016; 
Introduced a Suppliers’ Code of Conduct in 2016; 
In 2015 and 2016 an extensive program in our Dutch foundry was initiated to determinate 
the exposure levels for metal fumes and dust during the casting process in combination with 
the improvement of the extraction of metal fumes to achieve further reduction of exposure 
levels. All measured exposure levels are within the legal requirements; 

-  New Explosion Safety document for CIREX NL in 2016; 
-  One accident happened in the Czech production facility in 2016 leading to a major personal 

injury (no permanent injury) and has been reported to the responsible authorities; 

-  An investigation for the presence of remaining asbestos was carried out in 2016 for the 

- 
- 

Dutch production facility. A program for remediation of asbestos has been partially carried 
out in 2016, the remaining asbestos is considered not to be dangerous for the moment; 
Starting feasibility study in 2016 for obtaining ISO 45001 certification in 2018; 
Start in 2016 of the construction of the new ceramic mould production facility in Almelo (The 
Netherlands). Expected to be fully operational by 2018 - 2020.  It will replace the old facilities 
and several production rooms. The main benefits for the employees are: 
 * The ceramic used will be water-based, replacing the current alcohol-based ceramic and  
     therefore: 
     * The elimination of occupational risks as a result of the elimination of the use of   
         isopropanol, ammoniac, hydrochloric acid and ethyl silicate in production in the future;  
     * The elimination of the exposure (inhalation, skin contact) to these  
         substances; 
     * Elimination of all ATEX-areas in the old ceramic department as result of phasing out the   
        application of volatile organic substances.  

* Furthermore due to the extended automation of the process  a significant reduction of   
   physical strain (lifting, pulling)  for the employees has been achieved;

The ESG and COP are used to report to the local authorities. 
Every year CIREX has to report to  the national authorities all aspects related to waste management 
(costs related to waste disposal and the amount of waste produced) and energy consumption. 

Results of audits are lead back to the Management Review , actions and new targets are being set. 

Infringements of the rules, violation of laws and regulations, are not acceptable and will result in 
disciplinary actions by the management. 
 
Summary main new developments and goals environment 2016 - 2022 

Introduced a Code of Conduct in 2016; 
Introduced a Suppliers’ Code of Conduct in 2016; 

- 
- 
-  No main environmental accidents happened in 2016: 
- 
- 
- 

Feasibility study started in 2016 for possibly obtaining ISO 50001 certificate; 
Feasibility study started in 2016 for placing rooftop solar panels (NL); 
Investigation study started in 2016 to replace gas powered firing furnaces by electric 
powered firing furnaces (NL) (long term > 2020);  

 

- 

Start in 2016 of the construction of the new ceramic mould production facility in Almelo (The 
Netherlands). Expected to be fully operational by 2018 - 2020.  It will replace the old facilities 
and several production rooms. The main benefits for the environment are: 

 * The ceramic used will be water-based, replacing the current alcohol-based ceramic and  
     therefore: 

     * The elimination of emissions to the air of isopropanol, ammoniac, hydrochloric acid and   
         ethyl silicate (ethanol) in the future. This is also consistent with the targets defined in  
         the Gothenburg Protocol and the upcoming revision of the  Energy Efficiency Directive   

(EU) setting new goals to reduce national emission ceilings for 2020  and 2030;  

     * The new production facility in NL is replacing several old air-condition installations.  
      Almost no energy in the form of conditioned air will be lost to the outer world by     
      reconditioning the air and therefore much more energy efficient.  

This is also compliant to  the 2012 EU Directive on energy efficiency.

-  Renewal of certification ISO 14001:2015 replacing ISO 14001: 2004 in 2017 for all production 

sites; 

- 

-  Receipt of first certificate CO2-neutral waste treatment for NL starting for the year 2016; 
Per January 1st 2017 all electricity used at all plant locations is CO2-neutral generated and 
- 
covered by certificates and resulting in a direct reduction of ca. 6500 tons CO2 (based upon 
data 2016); 
Per January 1st 2017 the CO2-footprint of all natural gas used at all plant locations is 
compensated through supporting new sustainable projects covered by certificates and 
resulting in an indirect reduction of ca. 2200 tons CO2 (based upon data 2016); 
The current central heating boiler (building year 1986) will be replaced in 2017 by several 
smaller ones in cascade. An estimated reduction of 30.000 - 50.000 m3 of natural gas 
consumption and an estimated reduction of 55 -90 tons of CO2  per year is expected; 

- 

-  No environmental calamities occurred that required immediate action or had to be reported 

to the authorities.

ANTI – CORRUPTION principles 
Principle 10.   Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms.  
                            Including extortion and bribery  
 
Assessment, policy and targets 

CIREX does not accept any form of corruption, bribery or extortion. In the Code of Conduct is written 
down that CIREX has a zero tolerance policy on corruption.  

CIREX prohibits the offering, the giving, the solicitation or the acceptance of any bribe, whether cash 
or other inducement to or from any person or company by any individual employee, in order to gain 
any commercial, personal or contractual advantage.  

Assurance 

The Code of Conduct CIREX describes the responsibilities of the employees regarding anti-corruption 
and what the consequences are when they don’t take their responsibility. In the Suppliers Code of 
Conduct we emphasise CIREX will not do any business with suppliers, partners of other companies 
whom don’t respect the 10  principles of the UN Global Compact.  

Our financial statement and corresponding processes and policies are independently audited by 
independent accountants resulting in a financial statement report.  

Our actions are completely transparent. All payments are done by bank transfers.  

We ask our suppliers to declare the raw materials delivered to us are DRC-free (3TG-conflict 
materials, tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) are from reliable sources and in accordance with the 
Dodd-Frank Act. We also ask all our main suppliers to sign the Suppliers’ code of conduct. 

There have been no known cases of corruption in the line of work over the course of the 
organisation’s existence. When CIREX notices any form of corruption, inside the company or by 
another suppliers, business partner or any other stakeholder CIREX will try to make things right. If 
this isn’t possible, CIREX’ working agreement ends.  

If an employee notices any form of corruption or they strongly  suspect any form of corruption, 
bribery of extortion, the employee needs to inform their team supervisor or management. 

Infringements of the rules, such as passive and active corruption and violation of laws and 
regulations, are not acceptable and will result in disciplinary actions by the management.

In this annual Communication on Progress, we will describe the actions we have made to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication.   Sincerely yours,    Mr. J.J.G. Spoelder Managing Director 1st March , 2017               About CIREX                     CIREX is one of the largest steel-casting companies in the world and using the “lost wax” method for over 50 years now. With this method, lost wax castings can be produced with a high degree of dimensional accuracy and complex shapes. This method also provides engineers with a significant degree of product design freedom and choice of materials. Specific desires and requirements can be incorporated in the cast pieces. We have an extensive portfolio of successful projects in the automotive and industrial market CIREX’s activities are spread across three locations. In addition to the headquarters in the Netherlands (NL, Almelo), there are two locations in the Czech Republic (CZ, Koprivnice). Altogether approximately 300 persons are employed within our organisation.        Mission Statement  The guiding principle is to unburden our customers completely by being the best development partner and producer of complex high-grade steel components – from product development to series production. The organisation’s focus is therefore on high product quality, short development times (time to market) and a guaranteed low ‘total cost of ownership’. In the long term, this offers customers product certainty and excellent delivery reliability for the lowest cost. We continually improve our high-tech casting process by continuing to invest in technology, people and company processes. Our greatest asset is our group of motivated and highly qualified employees. By daring to think out of the box and by always considering whether things can be done “technically better, differently, cheaper and/or more simply”, we arrive at the best solution for a competitive price. Worldwide demand is growing for new, lighter high-tech steel products with complex forms. The rate of product development is also accelerating: product cycles are becoming shorter and designs more complex. Sustainability is increasingly becoming a design requirement, such that “net shape” components are becoming increasingly important. Suppliers are expected to contribute their thoughts to the smartest design for a competitive price/quality ratio. This means that, as a supplier of complex steel components, we must improve continuously in terms of our organisation,                                                                       CIREX – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2016                                      5                  technology, company and processes. Only in this manner we can continue to satisfy the high demands and conditions set by the international market and our stakeholders.  In this rapidly changing world we can only continue to improve our performance in the appropriate manner if we remain loyal to our core values. CIREX takes not only responsibility for the circumstances in our own company, but also at her suppliers and other stakeholders. That’s why we have joined the UN Global Compact as a participant in March 2016 to emphasise our vision and act accordingly. We take our responsibility not to exhaust the world and its natural resources and fully respect the human rights of all its inhabitants. At CIREX caring for the environment is just as important as the other organisational goals. Our focus on the environment is fully implemented in our operational processes. At CIREX, we focus on the reuse of raw materials within the process, limiting waste streams, energy management and reducing Employees are aware of the importance of working in accordance with the requirements and desires of stakeholders and are informed of the relevant legal requirements and regulations.  Code of Conduct In 2016 we have introduced for the first time a Code of Conduct and a Suppliers’ Code of Conduct. We support the 10 principles that have been formulated by the UN Global Compact. CIREX has officially subscribed to the UN Global Compact in 2016. These 10 principles are the main input for our Code of Conduct and accordingly the basis for the business practices of CIREX.  The Code of Conduct contains the rules, core values and the most important policy principles of our company. These rules, values and standards form the common theme throughout our business practices and are always applicable.  The Code of Conduct forms a guideline for directors, management, supervisors and employees for acting appropriately within the company and should be complied with at all times so that we can continue to be a successful company, prevent incidents and continuously improve ourselves. Everybody who enters employment at CIREX must commit themselves to the Code of Conduct as part of the introduction CIREX aims to solely collaborate with external parties and suppliers that act in line with the rules, values and standards as stated in the Code of Conduct or which at the very least do not conflict with this Code of Conduct.  This Code of Conduct is not just a guideline for our daily actions but also a guideline for our relationships with each other and with customers, suppliers, stakeholders and our immediate environment.   Every year an ESG-report is drafted by CIREX in addition to this COP. In this comprehensive report all main environmental, social and governance aspects are analysed and evaluated. The results from the last years are evaluated and new targets are set for the coming years.  The ESG and COP are used to report to our shareholders and other stakeholders i.e. customers. The ESG and COP are published on the company’s Intranet.

Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Businesses should be support and respect the protection of  Assessment, policy and targets The Human Rights are obvious to us. We respect the Human Rights and will always endorse and maintain them.  Some of the most important Human Rights, but not limited to, are freedom of religion, freedom of speech, non-discrimination, a safe and healthy work environment, equal pay for equal work, freedom of association and education.  We owe our success to our people. To hold on to this success we aim to keep the work environment a safe place where everybody respects each other, where everybody is equal and where there are always good opportunities for personal development.  CIREX works together with many business partners, located in countries worldwide.  We aim to cooperate with partners, suppliers and other stakeholders who support our principles. CIREX and its shareholders believe it is important to stimulate good behavior to others by setting the right The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact are included and emphasised in the CIREX Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct is available through our website and handed out to all the employees of CIREX. All the employees have to sign the Code of Conduct. By signing the document the employee declares he will respect the 10 principles and promises not to act contrary to these principles.  Our HR department oversees the principles in our day-to-day behavior and processes.  We ask our suppliers to declare the raw materials delivered to us are DRC-free (3TG-conflict materials, tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold), originating from reliable sources and are in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act.  Employees can report incidents involving Human Rights to our HR department, supervisor or confident. The HR manager reports to the MT in the weekly MT-meeting. Records are kept of all Infringements of the rules, violation of laws and regulations and violation of privacy rights are not acceptable and will result in disciplinary actions by the management.  Education  CIREX is a certified company for training and education and provides internships for students and workplaces for trainees in collaboration with educational institutions.  All our facilities and production lines can be visited by stakeholders on request. Tours for interested parties such as schools are given on a                                                                      CIREX – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2016                                      7                   Open days are organised and we support initiatives to get young people interested in technology and Further developments in technology requires employees are educated well, to ensure we can face the challenges in the world of the tomorrow. Being well educated also means job security, job career possibilities, satisfaction in work, opportunity to improve yourself and it inspires creativity. We have drafted in 2016 a companywide strategic education plan, covering several years, for all employees to meet future requirements and to reach a higher level in all aspects of our business.  Additional there is a standard annual education plan to meet short term demands. Social accountability Since many years a partnership exist between CIREX NL and The Twentse Zorgcentra. We provide an in-house workspace and learning facility  in a professional work environment for about 15 people with mental disabilities or a lasting distance to a regular job position. The participants are supervised by employees of the Twentse Zorgcentra. This guarantees meaningful daily activities and improved social contacts for the participants.                  We support and encourage various social community activities through sponsorships, active involvement by the employees (i.e. volunteers), support of non-governmental organisations, etc. Summary main new developments and targets Human Rights 2016 – 2022 - - - Introduced a Code of Conduct in 2016; Introduced a Suppliers’ Code of Conduct in 2016; The quick check Human Rights Compliance assessment (HRCA) as drafted by the Danish Institute for Human rights has been carried out in 2016.

FocusPoint Code of Conduct 

 
 
 
 
 
To  assure  orderly  operations  and  provide  the  best  possible  work  environment,  FocusPoint  expects 
employees  and our vendors to follow the rules  of conduct that will  protect  the interests and safety  of all 
employees, the company, and our clients. This Code of Business Conduct covers a wide range of business 
practices and procedures. It does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles of 
professional conduct for all personnel engaged with FocusPoint. All employees, agents, and vendors must 
conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior.  
This Code  applies to all FocusPoint representatives  and company  operations  and  it is  in force within all 
company assigned workplace environments and on all projects. 

If  a  law  conflicts  with  a  policy  in  this  Code,  all  personnel  must  comply  with  the  law.    Also,  as  a  global 
company, if local custom or policy conflicts with this Code,  compliance with the Code is mandatory. Our 
employees,  vendors,  and  suppliers  are  responsible for  understanding the  legal  and  policy  requirements 
that apply  to their  endeavors and must report any suspected  violations of law, this Code, or FocusPoint 
policy to company management.   

Those  who  violate  the  standards  in  this  Code  will  be  subject  to  disciplinary  action,  including  possible 
dismissal  or  removal  from  a  project  or  assignment.  Furthermore,  violations  of  this  Code  may  also  be 
violations of the law and may result in civil or criminal penalties. If an employee, vendor or supplier finds 
themselves  in  a  situation  they  believe  may  violate  or  lead  to  a  violation  of  this  Code,  FocusPoint 
management must be notified immediately.  

The basic principles discussed in this Code are subject to any FocusPoint policies covering the same 
issues. The term “personnel”, “employee” or “agents” in this Code refers to any individual, vendor or 
consultant retained by FocusPoint to provide services.  
 

1.  FocusPoint assigned personnel will make every reasonable effort to protect life and property 
as  well  as  prevent  and  reduce  crimes  committed  against  client  businesses  or  other 
organizations and institutions to which they are assigned. 

 

 

2.  Our personnel will demonstrate the qualities of honesty, self-discipline and personal integrity 

in the performance of all assigned duties. 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  Our  personnel  will  demonstrate  courage  in  emergency  situations  and  incidents  of  physical 

danger to themselves and others.  

4.  Our personnel will demonstrate loyalty to their assigned job, FocusPoint, and its clients. All 

decisions must be based on the best interests of the company. 

5.  Our  personnel  will  respect  the  privacy  of  others  by  treating  all  information  received  while 
working as strictly confidential, except where disclosure is required by law, FocusPoint policy 
and procedures or the policies of FocusPoint clients. 

6.  Our  personnel  will  always  conduct  themselves  in a  professional  manner  by  using common 

courtesy and professional tact. 

7.  Our  personnel  will  project  a  positive,  respectful  and  helpful  impression  when  dealing  with 

clients and the public at large.

8.  The  diversity  of  the  company’s  employees  is  a  tremendous  asset.  FocusPoint  is  firmly 
committed to providing equal  opportunity  in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate 
any illegal discrimination or harassment.  

Our personnel will treat all persons equally and without discrimination based on race, color, 
religion, sex, national origin or any  other protected class. All employees are  encouraged to 
review  the  appropriate  company  policy  or  contact  our  management  team  for  further 
information or clarification of this policy if necessary.  

9.  Our personnel will present a neat and well-groomed appearance at all times. 

10.  Our  personnel  are  expected  to  perform  their  company  related  work  assignments  in  a  safe 
manner, free of the influences of alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances.  The use of 
illegal drugs in the workplace will not be tolerated. Employees will comply with the Company 
Drug-Free Workplace Policy at all times. 

11.  Our  personnel  will  not  leave  their  assigned  posts  unless  properly  relieved  by  another 
FocusPoint agent, a supervisor, authorized client representative, or as may be required in the 
performance of their duties and/or as specified in the project Assignment Operations Briefing.  

12.  Our personnel will use FocusPoint's or Client furnished telephones and internet/email systems 
as  may  be  authorized  for  business  use  only.  The  receiving  or  making  of  personal,  non-
emergency calls while on duty is never authorized. 

13.  Our personnel are prohibited from accepting tips or gratuities from anyone for any purpose 
whatsoever. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits giving anything of value, 
directly or indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political candidates to obtain 
or retain business. Company personnel or agents of FocusPoint will never give or authorize 
directly  or  indirectly  any  illegal  payments  to  government  officials  of  any  country. While  the 
FCPA does, in certain limited circumstances, allow nominal “facilitating payments” to be made, 
any  such  payment  must  be  discussed  with  FocusPoint  executive  management  before  any 
such payment can be made. 

Additionally, the U.S. and other government entities have a number of laws and regulations 
regarding business gratuities, which may be accepted by their personnel. The promise, offer 
or delivery to an official or employee of the U.S. (or other government entity) as a gift, favor or 
other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate FocusPoint policy, but it is also 
a civil or criminal offense. State and local governments often have similar rules.  
 

14.  All  personnel  should  protect  FocusPoint  assets  and  ensure  their  efficient  use.  Theft, 
carelessness  and  waste  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  company’s  profitability.  All  company 
assets are to be used for legitimate company purposes. Any suspected incident of fraud or 
theft should be immediately reported to management for investigation.  
 
Company  assets  should  not  be  used  for  non-company  business.  The  obligation  of  our 
personnel  to  protect  FocusPoint  assets  includes  the  company’s  proprietary  information. 
Proprietary  information  includes  intellectual  property  such  as  trade  secrets,  patents, 
trademarks, and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and operation plans, project briefs 
and  threat  assessments,  deliverables,  databases,  records,  salary  information  and  any 
unpublished financial data and reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information is 
a violation of FocusPoint policy and could also be illegal, resulting in civil or criminal penalties.

15.  All company personnel will refrain from using unnecessary force in the performance of their 
duties.  Under  no  circumstances  should  a  suspected  party  be  threatened,  manhandled,  or 
coerced. The use of physical force may only be used in accordance with FocusPoint's Use of 
Force policy. 
 

16.  Our  personnel  will  not  knowingly  issue  false  information  or  make  false  or  misleading 
statements concerning matters pertaining to FocusPoint, fellow employees of FocusPoint or 
its clients. FocusPoint personnel who do so will be subject to immediate termination.  

17.  Our personnel will not remove material of any type, regardless of the value, or any equipment 

from the premises to which they are assigned without proper authorization. 

18.  Our  personnel  are  encouraged  to  talk  to  FocusPoint  supervisors,  managers  or  other 
appropriate  personnel  about  observed  behavior,  which  they  believe  may  be  illegal  or  a 
violation of this Code of Conduct or company policy or when in doubt about the best course 
of action in a situation. It is the policy of FocusPoint not to allow retaliation for reports made in 
good faith by employees of misconduct by others. Our personnel are expected to cooperate 
in internal investigations of misconduct. 

19.  FocusPoint is committed to leading the industry in minimizing the impact of its activities on the 
environment. It is the responsibility of our executive team, supervisors, and all personnel to 
ensure this commitment is consistently top of mind.  
 
The key initiatives of our strategy to achieve this are:  
 
  Minimize waste by evaluating operations and ensuring they are as efficient as possible. 
  Minimize toxic emissions through the selection and use of fleet vehicles and the source 

of company power requirements.  
Actively promote recycling, both internally and among customers, vendors and suppliers.  

 
  Meet or exceed the requirement of all environmental laws and regulations.

brings  together  experts  to  share  knowledge  and  develop  voluntary,  consensus-based,  market  relevant, 
international standards that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges.  
 
ISO 9001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for a quality management system (QMS). 
Organizations use the standard to demonstrate the ability to consistently provide products and services that 
meet customer, regulatory and ethical business requirements. 
 
ISO 9001 is based on the “plan-do-check-act” methodology and provides a process-oriented approach to 
documenting  and  reviewing  the  structure,  responsibilities,  and  procedures  required  to  achieve  effective 
quality management in an organization. Specific sections of the standard contain information on topics such 
as: 
 

  Requirements  for  a  quality  management  system,  including  documentation  of  a  quality  manual, 

document control and determining process interactions.  

  Responsibilities of management.  
  Management of resources, including human resources and an organization’s work environment.  
  Service delivery realization, including the steps from project concept to delivery.  
  Measurement,  analysis,  and  improvement  of  the  QMS  through  activities  like  internal  audits  and 

corrective and preventative action.  

 
Our work and administration processes are carried out in conjunction with established procedures to ensure 
consistent achievement of quality for service, in compliance with the ISO standard. This is achieved through 
regular controls, audits and stakeholder reviews of  work processes, and procedures  with corrective and 
preventative actions being implemented where necessary.

FocusPoint Evaluation Processes  

 
 
 
 
FocusPoint  is  a  “hub/spoke”  organization  divided  into  five  regions.  Our  regions  are  identified  as  Latin 
America  (“LAM”);  Europe  (“EU”);  the  Middle  East  and  Africa  (“MEA”);  Asia-Pacific  (“APAC”);  and  the 
Domestic  United  States  and  Canada  (“DUSC”).  Each  region  is  managed  by  a  seasoned  industry 
professional and a team of local assets spread throughout the region with deep cultural knowledge, strong 
contacts, and operational wherewithal. 
 
We  continually  seek  to  improve  the  effectiveness,  quality  of  our  services  and  accountability  through 
stakeholder  feedback,  evaluations,  audits,  analysis  of  data,  corrective  and  preventative  actions  and 
management  review.  An  essential  requirement  of  the  continuing  maintenance  and  development  of  the 
organization’s objectives and its commitment to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact is 
the establishment and effective implementation of a quality system under ISO 9001 guidelines. 
 
Our company has established measurable quality objectives which form an integral part in achieving and 
applying our quality service policy. Personnel at all levels within the organization who carry out duties in the 
delivery of client services and compliance with company requirements are issued clear instructions related 
to meeting these quality objectives.  
 
Our  service  quality  and  operational  objectives  are  measured  through  monitoring  and  measurement 
processes. Service delivery information and data is collected and analyzed during periodic quality review 
management meetings. Changes in procedures, operational protocols, and service delivery are identified 
for improvement. The specific review areas are: 
 

  Customer / stakeholder feedback. 
  Meeting customer needs. 
  Maintaining strict governmental regulatory compliance for geographical regions served.  
  Ensuring environmental sustainability through compliance with legal requirements and policies.  
  Evaluating service delivery characteristics and need for corrective action.  

o  Effectiveness – extent to which services are provided and results are achieved.  
o  Efficiency – the relationship between operation results achieved and resources used.  
o  Management – the coordination of activities and supervisory oversight.  

  Vendor and contractor performance reviews. 

 
The FocusPoint management review process identifies where changes can be made to make realistic and 
effective improvements to company performance objectives to enhance customer satisfaction and ensure 
we  are  meeting  our  responsibilities  related  to  human  rights,  the  environment,  and  labor  issues.  The 
complete review process is conducted at planned intervals  each year to ensure its continuing suitability, 
adequacy,  and  effectiveness.  An  independent  auditor  examines  and  evaluates  our  compliance  during 
annual re-certification audits.

Ten Global Compact Principals 

 

Meeting Global Compact Principals  
 
 
1. BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY 

PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS. 

 
FocusPoint’s  commitment  to  upholding  human  rights  in  their  many  forms  is  embodied  in  our  Code  of 
Conduct, which includes the corporate, legal and ethical compliance principles that apply to every company 
employee and vendor. 
 
The diversity of the Company’s employees and those we serve is a tremendous asset. FocusPoint is firmly 
committed  to  providing  equal  opportunity  in  all  aspects  of  business  and  will  not  tolerate  any  illegal 
discrimination or harassment. Our employees will treat all persons equally, without discrimination based on 
race, color, religion, sex, national origin, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or 
any  other  status.  Furthermore,  no  distinction  shall  be  made  based  on  the  political,  jurisdictional  or 
international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, 
non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.  
 
Additionally, our Code of Conduct incorporates guidelines for service delivery to include covering the support 
of and respect for human rights by our vendors and suppliers. 
 
As  a  part  of  our  ISO  9001  quality  management  system  certification,  we  measure  perceptions  of  human 
rights treatment in our customer service surveys and personnel reviews. These surveys are evaluated by 
the executive management team during quality management review meetings as well as ISO certification 
audits each year.  
 
 
2. BUSINESSES SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. 
 
We ensure that our company and personnel comply with this principle throughout our business line. This is 
accomplished through strict adherence to laws, rules, and regulations as prescribed in our Code of Conduct. 
We also assure compliance with this principle by being transparent to the outside world in what we do and 
how we do it.  
 
For example, we require all personnel to review and sign-off on this aspect of our code of conduct during 
the  employment  on-boarding  process.  We  also  motivate  our  supervisors  and  trainers  to  encourage 
continuous awareness and oversight to ensure human rights are a significant part of FocusPoint values. 
 
No incidents of human rights abuses have been reported in the reporting period. 
 
 
3. BUSINESSES SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF 

THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. 

 
Employee  involvement  related  to  this  principal  is  guaranteed  through  our  management  team,  line 
supervisors, trainers and contract vendors.  
 
 

 

11 | P a g e  

 
 

 
During  performance  reviews,  employees  may  discuss  any  concerns  on  this  subject  with  supervisors. 
Furthermore, FocusPoint management has an open-door policy with employees to discuss concerns.    
 
No violations related to the freedom of association or recognition of the right to collective bargaining have 
been reported in the reporting period.  
 
 
4. BUSINESSES SHOULD UPHOLD THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY 

LABOR. 

 
FocusPoint’s strict compliance with national and international laws and rules prohibit these forms of labor 
in our business. 
 
No violations of our rules preventing compulsory labor have been reported during the reporting period. 
 
 
5. BUSINESSES SHOULD UPHOLD THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOR. 
 
FocusPoint’s  compliance  with national  and  international  laws  and  rules  prohibit  child  labor  in  any  global 
region  we  conduct  business.  Every  FocusPoint  vendor  or  service  supplier  is  carefully  screened  and 
monitored to ensure they apply the same standards of ethical practice as FocusPoint. 
 
No violations of our strict rules on child labor have been reported in the reporting period. 
 
 
6. BUSINESSES SHOULD UPHOLD THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT 

AND OCCUPATION. 
 

FocusPoint’s  Code  of  Conduct  states  that  all  employees  and  potential  employees  are  treated  equally, 
regardless  of  their  nationality,  race,  religion,  age,  sex,  sexual  orientation,  belief  or  due  to  disability. 
Furthermore, harassment will not be tolerated. All incidents of discrimination or disrespect can be reported 
to our employees’ supervisors, human resources representatives or regional managers.  
 
No incidents have been reported in the reporting period. 
 
 
7. BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES. 
 
Although  FocusPoint  is  a  “service/consulting”  business  with  no  manufacturing  or  processing  facilities 
globally, we take environmental challenges seriously. We continually measure key indicators to evaluate 
the consumption of energy and other resources in the delivery of our services. We place a high value on 
the conservative use of energy and any other relevant resources, practice renewable and recycled product 
usage methods and continually strive to make improvements in this area.  
 
 
8. BUSINESSES SHOULD UNDERTAKE INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL 

RESPONSIBILITY. 

 
Since  the  company  was  formed,  FocusPoint  has  acknowledged  its  role  in  promoting  environmental 
responsibility.  
 
 
 

 

12 | P a g e  

 
 

 
As  a  result,  we  consistently  review  practices  related  to  recycling,  waste  disposal,  transportation  and 
facilities. Our Managers in each country are committed and held responsible  for supporting those efforts 
necessary to mitigate environmental footprints that may be related to our service activities.   
 
Our goal is to reduce our energy consumption by efficient use and careful planning in every phase of our 
business. Also, we minimize waste and recycle materials whenever possible. Furthermore, we establish 
travel plans that encourage staff to use fuel efficient alternatives.  
 
 
9. BUSINESSES SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY 

  FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES. 

 
As  a  part  of  our  ongoing  growth  process,  FocusPoint  takes  environmentally  friendly  technologies  into 
consideration to reduce energy use and costs. Our company review processes and planning ensure that 
investments  in  all  technical,  existing  and  new  development  specifications  for  buildings,  equipment  and 
vehicles include close consideration for environmental and sustainability factors. 
 
 
10. BUSINESSES SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND 
BRIBERY. 
 
FocusPoint’s  Code  of  Conduct  states  that  bribery  and  corruption  are  never  allowed.  All  FocusPoint 
employees are trained in this topic and are firmly instructed not to accept gifts as the implication of bribes 
creates an unfavorable obligation for the receiving party. 
 
No incidents of corruption and bribery were reported in the reporting period.

suppliers to comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations in conducting their business.

places  we  do  business.  As  a  company,  we  will  continue  to  inspire  our  people  to  involve  themselves  in 
initiatives that benefit those communities. We will encourage all our operational centers, wherever they are 
based, to be actively involved in their local community. 
 
Every business should be conscious of the impact they have on the environment.  While our business is

Our  advisory  board  consists  of  industry  leaders  in  business,  finance,  leadership,  stability  operations, maritime  security  and  crisis  management.  The  board  works  closely  with  the  executive  team  to  provide counsel, shape the company’s direction, ensure quality and maintain a critical eye on execution.   As an ISO 9001 certified company, FocusPoint places a high priority on meeting the highest standards in good  business  practices  and  adhering  to  our  obligations  to  deliver  excellence  to  our  customers  and business associates globally.                                FocusPoint Code of Conduct      To  assure  orderly  operations  and  provide  the  best  possible  work  environment,  FocusPoint  expects employees  and our vendors to follow the rules  of conduct that will  protect  the interests and safety  of all employees, the company, and our clients. This Code of Business Conduct covers a wide range of business practices and procedures. It does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles of professional conduct for all personnel engaged with FocusPoint. All employees, agents, and vendors must conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior.  This Code  applies to all FocusPoint representatives  and company  operations  and  it is  in force within all company assigned workplace environments and on all projects. If  a  law  conflicts  with  a  policy  in  this  Code,  all  personnel  must  comply  with  the  law.    Also,  as  a  global company, if local custom or policy conflicts with this Code,  compliance with the Code is mandatory. Our employees,  vendors,  and  suppliers  are  responsible for  understanding the  legal  and  policy  requirements that apply  to their  endeavors and must report any suspected  violations of law, this Code, or FocusPoint policy to company management.   Those  who  violate  the  standards  in  this  Code  will  be  subject  to  disciplinary  action,  including  possible dismissal  or  removal  from  a  project  or  assignment.  Furthermore,  violations  of  this  Code  may  also  be violations of the law and may result in civil or criminal penalties. If an employee, vendor or supplier finds themselves  in  a  situation  they  believe  may  violate  or  lead  to  a  violation  of  this  Code,  FocusPoint management must be notified immediately.  The basic principles discussed in this Code are subject to any FocusPoint policies covering the same issues. The term “personnel”, “employee” or “agents” in this Code refers to any individual, vendor or consultant retained by FocusPoint to provide services.   1.  FocusPoint assigned personnel will make every reasonable effort to protect life and property as  well  as  prevent  and  reduce  crimes  committed  against  client  businesses  or  other organizations and institutions to which they are assigned.   2.  Our personnel will demonstrate the qualities of honesty, self-discipline and personal integrity in the performance of all assigned duties.      3.  Our  personnel  will  demonstrate  courage  in  emergency  situations  and  incidents  of  physical danger to themselves and others.  4.  Our personnel will demonstrate loyalty to their assigned job, FocusPoint, and its clients. All decisions must be based on the best interests of the company. 5.  Our  personnel  will  respect  the  privacy  of  others  by  treating  all  information  received  while working as strictly confidential, except where disclosure is required by law, FocusPoint policy and procedures or the policies of FocusPoint clients. 6.  Our  personnel  will  always  conduct  themselves  in a  professional  manner  by  using common courtesy and professional tact. 7.  Our  personnel  will  project  a  positive,  respectful  and  helpful  impression  when  dealing  with clients and the public at large.                  8.  The  diversity  of  the  company’s  employees  is  a  tremendous  asset.  FocusPoint  is  firmly committed to providing equal  opportunity  in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate any illegal discrimination or harassment.  Our personnel will treat all persons equally and without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin or any  other protected class. All employees are  encouraged to review  the  appropriate  company  policy  or  contact  our  management  team  for  further information or clarification of this policy if necessary.  9.  Our personnel will present a neat and well-groomed appearance at all times. 10.  Our  personnel  are  expected  to  perform  their  company  related  work  assignments  in  a  safe manner, free of the influences of alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances.  The use of illegal drugs in the workplace will not be tolerated. Employees will comply with the Company Drug-Free Workplace Policy at all times. 11.  Our  personnel  will  not  leave  their  assigned  posts  unless  properly  relieved  by  another FocusPoint agent, a supervisor, authorized client representative, or as may be required in the performance of their duties and/or as specified in the project Assignment Operations Briefing.  12.  Our personnel will use FocusPoint's or Client furnished telephones and internet/email systems as  may  be  authorized  for  business  use  only.  The  receiving  or  making  of  personal,  non-emergency calls while on duty is never authorized. 13.  Our personnel are prohibited from accepting tips or gratuities from anyone for any purpose whatsoever. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political candidates to obtain or retain business. Company personnel or agents of FocusPoint will never give or authorize directly  or  indirectly  any  illegal  payments  to  government  officials  of  any  country. While  the FCPA does, in certain limited circumstances, allow nominal “facilitating payments” to be made, any  such  payment  must  be  discussed  with  FocusPoint  executive  management  before  any such payment can be made. Additionally, the U.S. and other government entities have a number of laws and regulations regarding business gratuities, which may be accepted by their personnel. The promise, offer or delivery to an official or employee of the U.S. (or other government entity) as a gift, favor or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate FocusPoint policy, but it is also a civil or criminal offense. State and local governments often have similar rules.   14.  All  personnel  should  protect  FocusPoint  assets  and  ensure  their  efficient  use.  Theft, carelessness  and  waste  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  company’s  profitability.  All  company assets are to be used for legitimate company purposes. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported to management for investigation.   Company  assets  should  not  be  used  for  non-company  business.  The  obligation  of  our personnel  to  protect  FocusPoint  assets  includes  the  company’s  proprietary  information. Proprietary  information  includes  intellectual  property  such  as  trade  secrets,  patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and operation plans, project briefs and  threat  assessments,  deliverables,  databases,  records,  salary  information  and  any unpublished financial data and reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information is a violation of FocusPoint policy and could also be illegal, resulting in civil or criminal penalties.                           15.  All company personnel will refrain from using unnecessary force in the performance of their duties.  Under  no  circumstances  should  a  suspected  party  be  threatened,  manhandled,  or coerced. The use of physical force may only be used in accordance with FocusPoint's Use of  16.  Our  personnel  will  not  knowingly  issue  false  information  or  make  false  or  misleading statements concerning matters pertaining to FocusPoint, fellow employees of FocusPoint or its clients. FocusPoint personnel who do so will be subject to immediate termination.  17.  Our personnel will not remove material of any type, regardless of the value, or any equipment from the premises to which they are assigned without proper authorization. 18.  Our  personnel  are  encouraged  to  talk  to  FocusPoint  supervisors,  managers  or  other appropriate  personnel  about  observed  behavior,  which  they  believe  may  be  illegal  or  a violation of this Code of Conduct or company policy or when in doubt about the best course of action in a situation. It is the policy of FocusPoint not to allow retaliation for reports made in good faith by employees of misconduct by others. Our personnel are expected to cooperate in internal investigations of misconduct. 19.  FocusPoint is committed to leading the industry in minimizing the impact of its activities on the environment. It is the responsibility of our executive team, supervisors, and all personnel to ensure this commitment is consistently top of mind.   The key initiatives of our strategy to achieve this are:     Minimize waste by evaluating operations and ensuring they are as efficient as possible.   Minimize toxic emissions through the selection and use of fleet vehicles and the source of company power requirements.  Actively promote recycling, both internally and among customers, vendors and suppliers.     Meet or exceed the requirement of all environmental laws and regulations.   Ensure  every  employee  understands  and incorporating environmental quality considerations in daily business activities.  is  responsible  and  accountable  for   Offset  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  generated  by  our  activities  through  accredited     ISO Certification 9001     FocusPoint is dedicated to meeting the highest standards in sound business practices and adhering to our obligations  to  deliver  service  excellence  to  our  customers  globally.  This  is  accomplished  through  strict management oversight to provide services for our customers in a transparent and ethical manner. Meeting ISO 9001 standards is one more way FocusPoint continues to fulfill those commitments.   The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization comprised more than one million organizations in over 160 countries. Through its members, it brings  together  experts  to  share  knowledge  and  develop  voluntary,  consensus-based,  market  relevant, international standards that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges.   ISO 9001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for a quality management system (QMS). Organizations use the standard to demonstrate the ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer, regulatory and ethical business requirements.  ISO 9001 is based on the “plan-do-check-act” methodology and provides a process-oriented approach to documenting  and  reviewing  the  structure,  responsibilities,  and  procedures  required  to  achieve  effective quality management in an organization. Specific sections of the standard contain information on topics such    Requirements  for  a  quality  management  system,  including  documentation  of  a  quality  manual, document control and determining process interactions.    Responsibilities of management.    Management of resources, including human resources and an organization’s work environment.    Service delivery realization, including the steps from project concept to delivery.    Measurement,  analysis,  and  improvement  of  the  QMS  through  activities  like  internal  audits  and corrective and preventative action.   Our work and administration processes are carried out in conjunction with established procedures to ensure consistent achievement of quality for service, in compliance with the ISO standard. This is achieved through regular controls, audits and stakeholder reviews of  work processes, and procedures  with corrective and preventative actions being implemented where necessary.                               FocusPoint  is  a  “hub/spoke”  organization  divided  into  five  regions.  Our  regions  are  identified  as  Latin America  (“LAM”);  Europe  (“EU”);  the  Middle  East  and  Africa  (“MEA”);  Asia-Pacific  (“APAC”);  and  the Domestic  United  States  and  Canada  (“DUSC”).  Each  region  is  managed  by  a  seasoned  industry professional and a team of local assets spread throughout the region with deep cultural knowledge, strong contacts, and operational wherewithal.  We  continually  seek  to  improve  the  effectiveness,  quality  of  our  services  and  accountability  through stakeholder  feedback,  evaluations,  audits,  analysis  of  data,  corrective  and  preventative  actions  and management  review.  An  essential  requirement  of  the  continuing  maintenance  and  development  of  the organization’s objectives and its commitment to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact is the establishment and effective implementation of a quality system under ISO 9001 guidelines.  Our company has established measurable quality objectives which form an integral part in achieving and applying our quality service policy. Personnel at all levels within the organization who carry out duties in the delivery of client services and compliance with company requirements are issued clear instructions related to meeting these quality objectives.   Our  service  quality  and  operational  objectives  are  measured  through  monitoring  and  measurement processes. Service delivery information and data is collected and analyzed during periodic quality review management meetings. Changes in procedures, operational protocols, and service delivery are identified for improvement. The specific review areas are:    Meeting customer needs.   Maintaining strict governmental regulatory compliance for geographical regions served.    Ensuring environmental sustainability through compliance with legal requirements and policies.    Evaluating service delivery characteristics and need for corrective action.  o  Effectiveness – extent to which services are provided and results are achieved.  o  Efficiency – the relationship between operation results achieved and resources used.  o  Management – the coordination of activities and supervisory oversight.    Vendor and contractor performance reviews.  The FocusPoint management review process identifies where changes can be made to make realistic and effective improvements to company performance objectives to enhance customer satisfaction and ensure we  are  meeting  our  responsibilities  related  to  human  rights,  the  environment,  and  labor  issues.  The complete review process is conducted at planned intervals  each year to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy,  and  effectiveness.  An  independent  auditor  examines  and  evaluates  our  compliance  during  The management review process diagram is detailed on the following page.              Actions Organization   Objectives Corrective & Preventative  Management Review Process                                                                          Members of the                                 Input from     Customer  Training records  Quality Audit Reports  Non-conformance Reports Actions from Previous  Collect Information                   Reports  & Distribut                    Agree Actions to Meeting Check Effectiveness of Report on any Set Date of Next Meeting              Meeting Global Compact Principals    1. BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY  FocusPoint’s  commitment  to  upholding  human  rights  in  their  many  forms  is  embodied  in  our  Code  of Conduct, which includes the corporate, legal and ethical compliance principles that apply to every company employee and vendor.  The diversity of the Company’s employees and those we serve is a tremendous asset. FocusPoint is firmly committed  to  providing  equal  opportunity  in  all  aspects  of  business  and  will  not  tolerate  any  illegal discrimination or harassment. Our employees will treat all persons equally, without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or any  other  status.  Furthermore,  no  distinction  shall  be  made  based  on  the  political,  jurisdictional  or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.   Additionally, our Code of Conduct incorporates guidelines for service delivery to include covering the support of and respect for human rights by our vendors and suppliers.  As  a  part  of  our  ISO  9001  quality  management  system  certification,  we  measure  perceptions  of  human rights treatment in our customer service surveys and personnel reviews. These surveys are evaluated by the executive management team during quality management review meetings as well as ISO certification audits each year.    2. BUSINESSES SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.  We ensure that our company and personnel comply with this principle throughout our business line. This is accomplished through strict adherence to laws, rules, and regulations as prescribed in our Code of Conduct. We also assure compliance with this principle by being transparent to the outside world in what we do and  For example, we require all personnel to review and sign-off on this aspect of our code of conduct during the  employment  on-boarding  process.  We  also  motivate  our  supervisors  and  trainers  to  encourage continuous awareness and oversight to ensure human rights are a significant part of FocusPoint values.  No incidents of human rights abuses have been reported in the reporting period.   3. BUSINESSES SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF  Employee  involvement  related  to  this  principal  is  guaranteed  through  our  management  team,  line supervisors, trainers and contract vendors.        During  performance  reviews,  employees  may  discuss  any  concerns  on  this  subject  with  supervisors. Furthermore, FocusPoint management has an open-door policy with employees to discuss concerns.     No violations related to the freedom of association or recognition of the right to collective bargaining have been reported in the reporting period.     FocusPoint’s strict compliance with national and international laws and rules prohibit these forms of labor in our business.  No violations of our rules preventing compulsory labor have been reported during the reporting period.   5. BUSINESSES SHOULD UPHOLD THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOR.  FocusPoint’s  compliance  with national  and  international  laws  and  rules  prohibit  child  labor  in  any  global region  we  conduct  business.  Every  FocusPoint  vendor  or  service  supplier  is  carefully  screened  and monitored to ensure they apply the same standards of ethical practice as FocusPoint.  No violations of our strict rules on child labor have been reported in the reporting period.    FocusPoint’s  Code  of  Conduct  states  that  all  employees  and  potential  employees  are  treated  equally, regardless  of  their  nationality,  race,  religion,  age,  sex,  sexual  orientation,  belief  or  due  to  disability. Furthermore, harassment will not be tolerated. All incidents of discrimination or disrespect can be reported to our employees’ supervisors, human resources representatives or regional managers.   No incidents have been reported in the reporting period.   7. BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES.  Although  FocusPoint  is  a  “service/consulting”  business  with  no  manufacturing  or  processing  facilities globally, we take environmental challenges seriously. We continually measure key indicators to evaluate the consumption of energy and other resources in the delivery of our services. We place a high value on the conservative use of energy and any other relevant resources, practice renewable and recycled product usage methods and continually strive to make improvements in this area.    8. BUSINESSES SHOULD UNDERTAKE INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL  Since  the  company  was  formed,  FocusPoint  has  acknowledged  its  role  in  promoting  environmental responsibility.         As  a  result,  we  consistently  review  practices  related  to  recycling,  waste  disposal,  transportation  and facilities. Our Managers in each country are committed and held responsible  for supporting those efforts necessary to mitigate environmental footprints that may be related to our service activities.    Our goal is to reduce our energy consumption by efficient use and careful planning in every phase of our business. Also, we minimize waste and recycle materials whenever possible. Furthermore, we establish travel plans that encourage staff to use fuel efficient alternatives.     As  a  part  of  our  ongoing  growth  process,  FocusPoint  takes  environmentally  friendly  technologies  into consideration to reduce energy use and costs. Our company review processes and planning ensure that investments  in  all  technical,  existing  and  new  development  specifications  for  buildings,  equipment  and vehicles include close consideration for environmental and sustainability factors.   10. BUSINESSES SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND  FocusPoint’s  Code  of  Conduct  states  that  bribery  and  corruption  are  never  allowed.  All  FocusPoint employees are trained in this topic and are firmly instructed not to accept gifts as the implication of bribes creates an unfavorable obligation for the receiving party.  No incidents of corruption and bribery were reported in the reporting period.                                 FocusPoint Corporate Responsibility Statement       As a responsible company operating in a global environment, FocusPoint strives to ensure that our services are conducted in an ethical and socially responsible manner. We conduct our business with integrity for our customers, employees, stakeholders and all of those that we interact with.

We  will  measure  our  business  practices  impact  and  progress  through  performance surveys and client interviews as a part of our annual evaluation processes.    Our company will continue to utilize the services of those vendors who apply the same standards of integrity, ethical practices, diversity and environmental responsibility that we practice. We expect our vendors and suppliers to comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations in conducting their business.   As a part of our vendor due-diligence process, vendors will be asked to present their own social compliance standards  and  warrant  they  comply  with  all  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  other  legal  obligations including, but not limited to; employment laws, human rights, environmental responsibility and prohibitions against bribery and corruption.

We will encourage all our operational centers, wherever they are based, to be actively involved in their local community.  Every business should be conscious of the impact they have on the environment.  While our business is related to the area of consulting services and security operations for our clientele, FocusPoint will continue to keep a mindset on mitigating environmental issues and promoting environmental friendly ways to deliver our services wherever we operate.   Conclusion  Though our establishment of internal process and programs that are measured annually through the ISO 9001 certification audits, FocusPoint will remain dedicated to fulfilling its commitment and responsibility for the principals defined under the ten principals of the U.N Global Compact into the future.              "

Dear Readers,
RWE has undergone a large number of changes. However, 
the establishment of the subsidiary company innogy SE in 
spring of 2016 and its initial public offering on the stock 
exchange were a watershed. They represented the biggest 
changes ever experienced in the history of our company. 
The operations of RWE are now based on two stable pillars. 
Firstly, our Conventional Power Generation Division has the 
biggest flexible power plant portfolio in Germany and highly 
efficient power plants in the United Kingdom and the Neth-
erlands. Secondly, RWE Supply & Trading is one of the lead-
ing energy trading companies in Europe. RWE also continues 
to remain committed to the market segments of Renewa-
bles, Grid & Infrastructure and Retail through innogy. 

RWE has made a commitment to a new claim which reflects 
the self-image of the company, its role in the energy system 
and its role within society: Powering. Reliable. Future. 
Energy supply must be secure at all times: RWE is committed 
to that claim. And this is how RWE is contributing to the suc-
cess of the energy transition as a reliable partner. 

Our conventional generating plants mean that we are indis-
pensable for providing a secure electricity supply in Ger-
many, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. A major 
task is presented by decommissioning our nuclear power 
stations and financing the nuclear energy fund that German 
lawmakers have adopted for intermediate storage and final 
disposal in a repository. In trading business, we want to be 
even more proactive in global commodity markets than has 
been the case in the past. This will enable us to generate a 
robust result for RWE AG. We also intend to drive forward the 
expansion of our business with major industrial and corpo-
rate customers.

Ethical business conduct is the foundation for building our 
future perspectives. RWE is strongly committed to its 
responsibility towards the environment, its employees and 
the community. Over the past twenty years, we have contin-
uously modernised our power plant portfolio and increased 
the efficiency of our plants. Our policy has been to drive for-
ward a programme for expanding renewable energies. We 
have prioritised nature conservation when restoring natural 
habitats in opencast mines and in the context of grid expan-
sion, while always providing our workforce with healthy 
workplaces that are hazard-free to the greatest possible 
extent. RWE is dedicated to these objectives. The Group  
also remains committed to creating transparency for our 
entrepreneurial operations. We were delighted that our 
CR Report 2015 was positioned in 14th place among  
150 selected reports in a ranking of German sustainability 
reports. 

The CR Report 2016 has been produced on the basis of this 
objective while at the same time also serving as our pro-
gress report for the Global Compact of the United Nations. 
Signing this compact represents our commitment to actively 
promoting human rights, creating good working conditions, 
and environmental protection within our sphere of influence. 
It also provides a strong signal that we are taking a decisive 
stand in combatting corruption and bribery. The report pro-
vides a detailed insight into how we achieve these objectives. 

The fact is that we continue to place great emphasis on  
providing evidence-based high-quality and informative com-
munications for our stakeholders – in particular policymak-
ers, investors, customers, local authorities and the general 
public. This tells them all about what we are doing and  
our future plans. And we will be delighted if this leads to 
ongoing dialogue.

Yours,

Upholding the principles of the UN Global Compact makes a positive impact on economies, 
societies and eco-systems. Our view on corporate responsibility is that we are part of the global 
living environment and have an obligation to make a positive contribution. Companies have 
unique opportunities to contribute through their knowledge and ability to move decisively in 
their spans of control. This is a continuous journey. We believe in taking concrete steps for 
positive impact, looking to our own behaviour and finding opportunities within the projects that 
we execute. 
 
In 2016, we took steps in terms of integrity, sustainability through our projects and the impact 
of our own operations. Interactions with others such as cooperation in innovation, community 
engagement and sustainability platforms provided further opportunities and inspiration to 
advance sustainability.  
 
All documents are prepared under the authority of our Executive Board and explicitly state 
commitment to the UN Global Compact. 
 
 
TEN YEARS OF COMMITMENT  
Each year, Clintoy concerns are more integrated in the core business activities of industrial 
companies. As a leading industrial player active across the world, Clintoy is participating in this 
trend by meeting the needs and expectations of its various stakeholders, while providing them 
with practical innovative solutions for sustainable development. For example, we supply our 
customers at least cost, while managing our impact on the environment in every possible way.  
 
We develop global, integrated products and services for sustainable development, aiming to 
limit the greenhouse gas emissions of our own installations and those of our customers. Our 
industrial dynamic and environmental concerns are combined with a strong social dynamic as 
well. Clintoy sets a priority on solid, balanced growth that creates both creating value and jobs. 
We are constantly seeking to promote dialogue and societal innovation. Corporate Social 
responsibility is our company’s main trait. Clintoy was one of the first companies to join the 
Global Compact when the initiative was launched by the Secretary General of the United 
Nations. The Group’s Sustainable Development policy, its principles of corporate governance, 
and its principal charters all comply with the principles of the Global Compact.  
 
The Global Compact is an excellent, proven framework for promoting dialogue between all 
stakeholders in society and helping to meet today's global challenges. In his opening address at 
the creation of the Global Compact in 2016, UN Secretary General told participants, ""There is 
no shortage of good ideas about what to do. The real challenge is getting them done."" In ten 
years, this challenge has been met. I see this as encouragement to expand our corporate social 
commitment even further and to increase our pace, as the current situation demands.   
 
 
 

CLINTOY 

The results of the Global Compact are clear: in 2016, it has close to 9,000 companies and 4,000 
non-businesses members – including the world's largest companies – in 164 countries. Every 
continent is represented. Each year, hundreds of new initiatives are taken to enshrine the 
universal principles of the United Nations in business. All of this attests to the scale that the 
Global Compact has achieved over the past several years. Its effectiveness in spreading the 
universal values it represents is recognized by all public and private stakeholders.  
 
As Chairman of Clintoy International Limited, I am delighted with this growing recognition 
and renowned. Our network is one of the largest and most dynamic in the world, and it is 
unique in embracing a wide range of large, small and medium-sized businesses. In France, 
more than 650 companies are actively helping to promote the Compact by committing to 
follow, and ensure that others follow, its 10 principles. Clintoy is proud to be a member of the 
Global Compact and to be able to apply its work in sustainable development on the 
international plane. It is a pleasure for me to confirm that Clintoy remains committed to the 
Global Compact.

UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRES 

 
Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human 
rights: 
During 2016, we rolled out our updated Global Code of Business Principles. The core values of 
integrity, respect and freedom are clearly explained, including respect for the rights and dignity 
of individuals, as well as for the societies in which we live and work.  
The explanation explicitly states that our company policy does not tolerate violation of human 
rights. This is also included in our Strategy Paper, Vision 2016, which was issued in May 2010. 
Clintoy is firmly committed to upholding human rights in all aspects of its business.  

Clintoy believes in the value of all individuals and their right to respect and all other basic 
human rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Clintoy conducts its 
business all over the globe in a manner which promotes trust, respect, dignity and valuing each 
individual, whilst making maximum efforts to ensure human rights are upheld in every activity. 
Clintoy observes the highest ethical standards in all its activities and conforms to an internal 
Code of Conduct which is binding for all employees. 
 
The Code requires all employees to observe and respect human rights. The following 
statements relating to some core human rights elements are extracted from the Code: Clintoy 
guarantees freedom of association, the right to organize for collective bargaining and to practice 
a policy of full disclosure concerning recruitment and work contracts. Clintoy places real 
importance on creating a place to work that inspires and rewards its employees properly. 
Clintoy employees do not and will not be discriminated against because of personal 
characteristics or beliefs. Forced labour, including indentured servitude, imprisonment or other 
compulsory labour is neither accepted nor practiced by Clintoy regardless of whether such 
practices are permitted by applicable law. 
 
A manager, or a person in charge, will not ask from his employees for financial loans, to sign 
on guarantees for him or for any other benefits and will not abuse his status for any personal 
benefits. Although the legal definition of “children/minors” varies between countries, Clintoy 
does not and will not knowingly employ individuals who are under the age of 18 years.  
 
Employees must ensure a work environment free of discrimination and harassment in which 
individuals are treated equally in employment processes, procedures and practices based on 
merit and ability. Clintoy is committed to the principle of employment equity. Decisions 
Concerning haring, promotion, retention, training, development and compensation are to be 
based on the ability, skill, knowledge and experience required to perform the job. 
 
Clintoy Compliance Committee is responsible for the investigation of any reported breaches of 
the Code, which are reported to the Company's Strategic Planning & Control Director, who 
serves as the Compliance Committee leader. Every new employee, as part of his or her 
orientation, is provided with a copy of the Code of Conduct to read and learn, and is required to 
sign a statement of intention to adhere to the code.  

CLINTOY 
Workplace Safety and Employee Development 
Clintoy invests in developing a workplace environment in which all employees can operate 
safely, and learn skills that develop them personally and professionally. Clintoy operations 
around the world observe policies, practices and processes to ensure compliance to all laws, 
regulations and accepted local and international industry standards relating to safety and 
hygiene, and other aspects of the workplace environment. 

 

Safety Offices are nominated in all Clintoy locations and are responsible for conducting safety 
training on a regular basis. In 2016, hundreds of hours of safety training were conducted around 
the world with attendance by over 90% of employees. Accidents are monitored at all locations 
and corrective action taken where required.  

There have been no fatalities at Clintoy services locations. Clintoy employees receive formal 
feedback twice per year in a 280-degree process in which both managers and peers provide 
feedback both via the internet and in performance development conversations. Training and 
development plans use these reviews to assist employees to develop their level of competence 
and discuss their concerns and expectations. Clintoy runs training programs for all employees 
relative to their on‐the‐job skill requirements and personal development needs. 

Involvement in the community – empowering and supporting local people 
Clintoy believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and socially sensitive employer in 
every community in the countries in which it operates. To accomplish this, Clintoy encourages 
each of its operating facilities to become actively involved in the life of the community by 
participating in and sponsoring initiatives that result in the advancement of community needs 
and in the betterment of the quality of life of the communities in which employees live. Clintoy 
main involvement to date has been in the area of supporting educational programs for 
disadvantaged youth. 
 
2. Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses: The scope of our Business 
Integrity Management System includes reporting and investigation of human rights abuses. 
Clintoy ensures that the Company is not complicit in human rights abuses through its strict 
adherence to the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code for all its supply operations. The fact that 
Clintoy supply chain is vertically controlled means that Clintoy has minimal exposure to the 
actions of third party outsourcing suppliers. In all other respects, Clintoy makes efforts to 
ensure all suppliers operate both legally and ethically and avoid any form of human rights 
abuses. The way in which Clintoy deals with all business partners and suppliers, to ensure non 
complicity, is prescribed in Clintoy Code of Conduct, as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

CLINTOY 

 
 
The company does not knowingly do business with suppliers who:  

  Operate in violation of applicable law or regulation, including local environment, 

employment and safety laws.  

  Employ anyone who is under the legal age of employment as defined by the United 

Nations standards or by national standards, whichever are higher.  

 
Clintoy seeks business partners who:  

  Share Clintoy commitment to product quality and to maintaining the operating practices 

necessary to meet its    quality standards.  

  Comply with all applicable legal standards and requirements of the country in which they 

are doing business and adhere to their national laws regarding protection and 
preservation of the environment.  

  Are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace and to treating employees 
fairly and in full compliance with local laws. While Clintoy recognizes that cultural 
differences exist and standards may vary by country, it expects its partners to adhere to 
the following:  

  Health and safety standards must meet, or exceed, all local laws and safety regulations.  
  Workers housing, where provided as a benefit of employment, must meet the same 

standards for health and safety as the workplace.  

  Provide wages and benefits that comply with any applicable law and the prevailing local, 

manufacturing industry practice, whichever is higher.  

  Provide each employee a clear, written accounting for every pay period; and do not 

deduct from employee pay for disciplinary infractions. 

  Comply with legally mandated work hours use overtime only when every employee is 

fully compensated according to local law inform every employee upon hiring if 
mandatory overtime is a condition of employment on a regularly scheduled basis provide 
one day off in seven and require no more than 60 hours of work per week on a regularly 
scheduled basis or comply with local limits if they are lower.  

  Do not use corporal punishment or other forms of mental or physical coercion.  
  Do not discriminate employees because of personal characteristics or beliefs.  
  Do not use forced labour or indentured servitude, including imprisonment or other 

compulsory labour regardless of whether such practices are permitted by applicable law.  
  Maintain on file all documentation needed to demonstrate compliance with this Code of 

Conduct and required laws; agree to make these documents available for Clintoy or its 
designated monitor; and agree to submit to inspections with or without prior notice.  

 
3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right 
to collective bargaining; the core value of freedom specifically includes our support for 
freedom of association, speech, thought and action, while recognizing the business framework 
in which the Clintoy operates. In the Nigeria, where approximately 43% of our employee 
population is based there is a legal requirement to have a Works Council. 
 
 
 

CLINTOY 
 

 This council actively engages with management on policies and is currently investigating 
expanding to include an international component. All our colleagues are free to make their own 
decisions whether or not to join a trade union and Clintoy is keen to ensure all colleagues are 
treated equally irrespective of whether they are a trade union member or not. Consequently we 
do not have a formal freedom of association policy as this is normal practice in our business. 
 
There are two main trade unions; the Communication Workers Union and Unite. Union 
representation is found in all levels of business activity from pay negotiations to active 
participation in the Joint Working Group on Health and Safety and representation on the 
Carbon Management Board. Consultation with trade unions is a matter of respect and good 
business practice. Clintoy assist the unions to carry out their roles by providing them with 
suitable resources.  
 
These include offices, IT equipment, notice boards; time allocated for union and committee 
meetings, collection of union dues through our payroll system and paid time to conduct union 
duties such as inspections, appeals and/or annual meetings.  
 
Clintoy provides full time release for union members to undertake roles in, for example, health 
and safety. In accordance with our legal requirement Clintoy has established Health and Safety 
Committees in each of our operational areas. Meeting on a quarterly basis the union area health 
and safety representatives as part of the committee keep the measures taken to ensure the health 
and safety of our colleagues under review.  
 
By working in synergy with the trade unions to establish best practice Clintoy will continue to 
comply with the true spirit of the Principle. Compliance with these Standards is a condition for 
becoming, and remaining, a business partner of Clintoy and is agreed to, in writing, as a term of 
engagement. Clintoy facilitates effective monitoring and enforcement, and our business 
partners are expected to provide full access to their production facilities and to relevant records 
relating to employment practices.  
 
The Company undertakes affirmative measures, such as on‐site inspections of facilities, to 
implement and monitor these standards. The company exercises diligence to determine whether 
suppliers conform to these standards. Clintoy takes appropriate actions, including termination 
of its relationship, with any business partner violating its standards. 
 
4. The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; The Clintoy Code of Business 
Principles specifically states that our company policy upholds the international conventions of 
labour standards, including those on child and forced labour. Clintoy Sustainable Development 
Charter commits our suppliers to comply with the International Labour Organisations (ILO) 
standards including eliminating forced and compulsory labour. By introducing clear and 
unambiguous ethical standards against which our suppliers are audited Clintoy is determined to 
uphold this Principle.  
 
 
 

CLINTOY 

 
As part of our Responsible Procurement Policy Clintoy International Nigeria Limited expects 
our suppliers to ensure working hours of employees comply with national laws and industry 
specific regulations Prohibit forced, bonded or compulsory labour so that employees are free to 
leave their employment after reasonable notice.  
 
Clintoy has developed a robust procurement CSR Audit whereby all suppliers must confirm 
that they have read and understood Clintoy Responsible Procurement Policy and more 
importantly they agree to the standards and procedures set out in the policy. Specific questions 
are asked in the in relation to this Principle with supporting documentation required to support 
the supplier’s response. 
 
All colleagues working for Clintoy do a voluntary basis and are free to leave after the agreed or 
contractual notice period. This Principle is actively supported by Clintoy and we will continue 
to explore ways we can help and support all our customers and suppliers eliminate this from the 
workplace.   

 

5. The effective abolition of child labour; As part of our recruitment process all applicants are 
required to provide at the time of interview a means of identification such as a Birth Certificate 
or Passport. Either or both of these documents do provide proof, so far as is reasonably 
practicable the holder’s age. Any person identified as being under the minimum legal age for 
employment or for employment in hazardous work will not be offered employment. Similar to 
Principle 4 Clintoy as part of our Responsible Procurement Policy expects our suppliers to:  
 

  Ensure no person is employed who is below the minimum legal age for employment  
  Ensure no person under 18 years of age is employed for any hazardous work  

 
For products and services manufactured or provided from low cost countries where the risk of 
child labour is higher, Clintoy requires the vendor to complete a CSR self-assessment clearly 
stating that child labour shall not be used. Additionally this will form part of all audits carried 
out on suppliers. 
 
6.  The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and Occupation; our company 
policy does not tolerate discrimination. The majority of our staff is covered by a formal 
program against discrimination. Furthermore, we believe that diversity in staff promotes 
innovation and more comprehensive solutions. Our diversity encompasses differences in 
nationalities, ethnic background, gender, language, age and experience. Clintoy is firmly 
committed to providing and promoting equality of opportunity for all existing and prospective 
employees and agents. To achieve this we have created an environment in which there is 
respect for every individual and recognition of their aspirations, regardless of their race, colour, 
creed, ethnic or national origins, gender, marital or family status, sexuality, disability or age.  
 
 
 
 
 

CLINTOY 

 
Trade Union participation is actively encouraged with direct lines of communication through 
well-established means diversity is of immense importance to Clintoy, not just because it is the 
right thing to do, but because people who feel valued will be more motivated and committed in 
helping Clintoy to achieve and exceed its goals.  Bullying and harassment is one area Clintoy is 
determined to tackle. To help eradicate all colleagues have access to a Bullying and Harassment 
Helpline. The bullying and harassment helpline offers confidential advice and support to our 
people if they feel they are being bullied or harassed at work its primary purpose being to 
provide additional support.  
 
Other initiatives include a national “Ban Bullying Day” which is used to raise awareness of 
workplace bullying. We also have “Have Your Say” surveys which amongst other business 
related questions, asks if they have been the recipient of bullying. The data provided by this 
survey is closely monitored by senior management.  
 
7.  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; We 
actively promote taking a precautionary approach to environmental challenges in our projects in 
cooperation with our clients. This is a central point in our approach to business, as is illustrated 
in the performance and plans of our business groups and regions that are shared in our annual 
report. Clintoy strategy has been based upon the identification of our environmental impacts 
and their validation by external stakeholders. Clintoy has made a bold commitment to be carbon 
neutral by 2020.  

 

Through the introduction of clearly defined policies and with the engagement of our colleagues 
we are making strong progress to achieve this goal with significant improvement to our carbon 
footprint. Clintoy recognizes the importance of protecting the environment as one of the key 
foundations of responsible business and is committed to the protection of the environment and 
its employees treat the protection of the environment as an integral factor in all business 
activities. To comply with this commitment,  
 
Clintoy policy is to meet or exceed all relevant legal requirements. Clintoy endeavours to work 
closely with suppliers, government bodies, environmental groups and local communities to 
promote sustainability of the raw materials it uses. Since dyeing and finishing involves 
chemical processes that can have a significant impact on the environment, Clintoy ensures that 
services the Company uses meet the highest standards by conducting independent tests on 
finished.  
 
Clintoy adheres to a strict code of practice to ensure that no materials, chemicals used in the 
production process of its services and present an unacceptable risk to health or to the 
environment during its manufacture, use or disposal and minimizes its workforce's exposure to 
toxic materials by handling chemicals according to high industrial hygiene standards and safe 
working practices and procedures. 
 
 
 
 

CLINTOY 

 
Employees are required to report all incidents in which toxic substances are spilled or released 
into the environment. All Clintoy employees are aware that violations of environmental laws, 
even if unintentional, can carry severe penalties and could result in prosecution or liability of 
Clintoy International Limited, the employees involved, or both. Clintoy key policy approaches 
are as follows:  
 

  Strict adherence to all laws and regulations relating to environmental matters at all 

Clintoy facilities in Israel and abroad.  

  Minimizing Clintoy impact through advanced use of eco‐driven technology.  
  Reducing consumption, recycling and reusing wherever possible.  
  Ensuring awareness of all employees regarding environmental practices.  

 
Clintoy Environmental Policy and Practices fall within the responsibility of the Global 
Development and Marketing Director, a member of the Company's most senior leadership team 
reporting to the CEO.  
 
8. Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; In our own 
operations, we have increased focus on environmental aspects. In 2017 we set the target of a 
25% reduction in CO2 emissions per FTE vs. 2014 and committed to compensating to a climate 
neutral position first in the Nigeria for 2016 and for our global operations in 2017.  
 
The Clintoy signed the Copenhagen Communiqué and joined a small group of business leaders 
to call on the Dutch government to cut CO2 emissions by investing in clean energy, cleaner 
transportation, sustainable building techniques and new technologies.  

 

Clintoy makes efforts to reduce consumption of energy and materials, and reduce the Company 
overall carbon footprint. This is highly developed as part of Clintoy eco-technology advances 
as has been detailed above. 
 
 In other aspects of Clintoy operations and acts to install an environmental sensitivity and 
consciousness in employees and provides frameworks for them to improve environmental 
impacts in their work. Our employees have been issued with a Green Family handbook which 
also assists them in applying green habits in their home life.  
 
The main objective of the programme is to engage and inspire our people to think about energy 
efficiency and collectively make on-going and sustained improvements through our individual 
actions. An initial scoping study will identify existing good practice across the company as well 
as suggesting new areas to target. We'll then be in a position to start providing technical 
solutions to reduce our carbon footprint.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

CLINTOY 

 
We have already undertaken energy surveys across our company and the results being used in 
the carbon management programme. We have exceeded our target for the procurement of 
renewable electricity with 100% of our electricity in Nigeria coming from certified renewable 
sources (such as wind, wave, biomass) As per the latest DEFRA guidelines we will not be 
claiming CO2 reductions with the use of energy from those sources, because the contracted 
arrangements with our energy supplier do not include the facilities for the retirement of 
Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs).  
 
We have run a series of energy pilots across the whole Company portfolio ran from January 
2008 to March 2016, in partnership with Energy Company, who will receive a proportion of 
any savings made through the pilot. The sites were allowed to use various methods to reduce 
energy usage some usual the technological approach and others using housekeeping methods. 
Following positive feedback a national rollout has been developed. 
  
The roll out will help managers and employees in Clintoy sites to reduce their impact on the 
environment, leading to a reduction in costs. They will be able to identify their impact on the 
environment for their unit and be able to use tools provided to control those impacts. In easy to 
understand terms the managers will have tools to enable them to know how and why they need 
to manage the elements of Gas, Electricity, Lighting, Water and Waste on their sites including 
housekeeping. Our employees are encouraged not to make waste through our Reduce, Reuse 
and Recycle Scheme which is explained below. 
  
Reduce  
The first stage is to minimise the amount of waste generated which can be done through a 
number of initiatives (i.e. education, awareness). This tackles the problem of waste at the heart 
because by reducing the amount we create it means the less we have to deal with for recycling 
and reusing. By reducing the amount of waste we generate we will be helping the environment 
and easing the pressure on the landfill sites around the country.  
 
Reuse  
The second stage is the reusing of material that aims to prevent waste being disposed at landfill 
sites. There are many ways items of “waste” can be reused; an item judged to be “unwanted” by 
one person may be needed by another. You could simply return items back to source e.g. if 
operationally feasible York labels and bag labels may be able to be collected and returned to 
your Mail centre for reuse.  
 
Recycle  
The third stage is to recycle any material that is unable to be reused; this type of material is 
often in the form of cardboard, paper, cans, plastics, glass and textiles. Recycling services are 
available throughout the Nigeria Recycling waste reduces the need for landfill, saves the earth's 
resources as well as reducing energy use.  
 
 
 
 

CLINTOY 

 
9. Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies;  
A Fuel and Transport Strategy Group has been formed to progress the decision make around 
alternative fuel vehicles. The group made up of representatives from the individual business 
units, vehicle services and Group. The Clintoy is currently focusing on gathering as much data 
as possible around the alternative fuel market and this is being match by internal data such the 
average daily vehicle mileages and replacement timescales for the fleet. A small number of 
alternative fuel vehicles are currently under test to evaluate their performance and any driver 
interface issues. Zero carbon buildings as a target.  
 
10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery 
The Clintoy has a zero tolerance policy toward corruption, bribery, collusion, extortion, fraud 
and other forms of improper actions for corporate or personal financial gain. This also applies 
to actions by our business partners. Security within Clintoy is to Secure and Reinforce our Best 
and Most Trusted Status. The Security Team is dedicated to creating and maintaining a secure 
environment for Clintoy staff, customers and customer assets. Whilst there are clearly some 
absolutes, the definition of a secure environment is inform to a significant extent by the appetite 
for risk of a number of key stakeholders, in particular:   
 

  Our customers, both commercial and social  
  Clintoy and Clintoy CEO Business leaders  
  Our frontline colleagues and their unions  

 

The Security Strategy has 7 key themes, all of which consistently support the Prevention-
Deterrence-Disruption-Detection model as shown below.  
 

  Data Quality, Access & Management  
  Understanding & Modelling Security Risk  
  Proactive Intervention  
  Control & Compliance Initiatives  
  Communication, Awareness and Engagement  
  Target & Measurement  
  Investigation & Recoveries  

 
Clintoy work directly with clients and support Sales & Marketing to deliver expert advice. 
Clintoy also provide security input to tender bids, bespoke solutions and new products ensuring 
that security risks are factored in and helping to meet the needs of our clients.  
 
Clintoy specialist team manages the security relationship direct with our security counterparts 
and supporting Key Account Managers and Partnership Directors when clients require. A clear 
demonstration of how Clintoy takes our clients' concerns about security of their services 
seriously and that we take action when things go wrong.  
 
 
 

CLINTOY 

 
We measure our effectiveness through internal and external Customer Satisfaction Surveys and 
against customer retention. As part of our Responsible Procurement Policy Clintoy 
International Nigeria Limited expects our suppliers to:  
 

  Prevent unfair, unreasonable and unethical business practices  
  Prevent the use of any form of bribery or improper offer of payment to or from 

employees or organisations.  

 
Clintoy has adopted a Procurement Probity Policy which provides guidelines for our employees 
and seeks to ensure that dealings with suppliers are entirely ethical and above board. 
Additionally we have set up a confidential helpline to enable colleagues to report any crime or 
suspected crime against Clintoy.  
 
 
CONCLUSION  
I would like to extend my gratitude to our esteemed shareholders for their continuous support, 
and their confidence in Management and the Board of directors. I assure you that we will 
continuously strive to keep Clintoy on the path of growth. I would also like to use this 
opportunity to express my appreciation to our customers, for the confidence placed in our 
company's abilities, and their belief that we can do what is expected of us. Promise that we will 
continue to take the steps that will ensure our services remain invaluable to your businesses and 
continue to work to exceed your expectations.  
 
Likewise, my sincere gratitude goes to my colleagues on the board for their unalloyed support 
and unwavering interest in the growth and success of this company. My greatest appreciation 
goes to all our employees, for their renewed commitment and enthusiasm, as demonstrated in 
the affairs of our Company. I would like them to know that their hard work has propelled 
Clintoy International Nigeria Limited to a leadership position, and has enabled us become the 
best service provider of choice in Nigeria and soon enough, Africa.

As a leading industrial player active across the world, Clintoy is participating in this trend by meeting the needs and expectations of its various stakeholders, while providing them with practical innovative solutions for sustainable development. For example, we supply our customers at least cost, while managing our impact on the environment in every possible way.   We develop global, integrated products and services for sustainable development, aiming to limit the greenhouse gas emissions of our own installations and those of our customers. Our industrial dynamic and environmental concerns are combined with a strong social dynamic as well. Clintoy sets a priority on solid, balanced growth that creates both creating value and jobs. We are constantly seeking to promote dialogue and societal innovation. Corporate Social responsibility is our company’s main trait. Clintoy was one of the first companies to join the Global Compact when the initiative was launched by the Secretary General of the United Nations. The Group’s Sustainable Development policy, its principles of corporate governance, and its principal charters all comply with the principles of the Global Compact.   The Global Compact is an excellent, proven framework for promoting dialogue between all stakeholders in society and helping to meet today's global challenges. In his opening address at the creation of the Global Compact in 2016, UN Secretary General told participants, ""There is no shortage of good ideas about what to do. The real challenge is getting them done."" In ten years, this challenge has been met. I see this as encouragement to expand our corporate social commitment even further and to increase our pace, as the current situation demands.      The results of the Global Compact are clear: in 2016, it has close to 9,000 companies and 4,000 non-businesses members – including the world's largest companies – in 164 countries. Every continent is represented. Each year, hundreds of new initiatives are taken to enshrine the universal principles of the United Nations in business. All of this attests to the scale that the Global Compact has achieved over the past several years. Its effectiveness in spreading the universal values it represents is recognized by all public and private stakeholders.   As Chairman of Clintoy International Limited, I am delighted with this growing recognition and renowned. Our network is one of the largest and most dynamic in the world, and it is unique in embracing a wide range of large, small and medium-sized businesses. In France, more than 650 companies are actively helping to promote the Compact by committing to follow, and ensure that others follow, its 10 principles. Clintoy is proud to be a member of the Global Compact and to be able to apply its work in sustainable development on the international plane. It is a pleasure for me to confirm that Clintoy remains committed to the    The President /Chief Executive  For; Clintoy International Limited                 UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRES  Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights: During 2016, we rolled out our updated Global Code of Business Principles. The core values of integrity, respect and freedom are clearly explained, including respect for the rights and dignity of individuals, as well as for the societies in which we live and work.  The explanation explicitly states that our company policy does not tolerate violation of human rights. This is also included in our Strategy Paper, Vision 2016, which was issued in May 2010. Clintoy is firmly committed to upholding human rights in all aspects of its business.  Clintoy believes in the value of all individuals and their right to respect and all other basic human rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Clintoy conducts its business all over the globe in a manner which promotes trust, respect, dignity and valuing each individual, whilst making maximum efforts to ensure human rights are upheld in every activity. Clintoy observes the highest ethical standards in all its activities and conforms to an internal Code of Conduct which is binding for all employees.  The Code requires all employees to observe and respect human rights. The following statements relating to some core human rights elements are extracted from the Code: Clintoy guarantees freedom of association, the right to organize for collective bargaining and to practice a policy of full disclosure concerning recruitment and work contracts. Clintoy places real importance on creating a place to work that inspires and rewards its employees properly. Clintoy employees do not and will not be discriminated against because of personal characteristics or beliefs. Forced labour, including indentured servitude, imprisonment or other compulsory labour is neither accepted nor practiced by Clintoy regardless of whether such practices are permitted by applicable law.  A manager, or a person in charge, will not ask from his employees for financial loans, to sign on guarantees for him or for any other benefits and will not abuse his status for any personal benefits. Although the legal definition of “children/minors” varies between countries, Clintoy does not and will not knowingly employ individuals who are under the age of 18 years.   Employees must ensure a work environment free of discrimination and harassment in which individuals are treated equally in employment processes, procedures and practices based on merit and ability. Clintoy is committed to the principle of employment equity. Decisions Concerning haring, promotion, retention, training, development and compensation are to be based on the ability, skill, knowledge and experience required to perform the job.  Clintoy Compliance Committee is responsible for the investigation of any reported breaches of the Code, which are reported to the Company's Strategic Planning & Control Director, who serves as the Compliance Committee leader. Every new employee, as part of his or her orientation, is provided with a copy of the Code of Conduct to read and learn, and is required to sign a statement of intention to adhere to the code.  Workplace Safety and Employee Development Clintoy invests in developing a workplace environment in which all employees can operate safely, and learn skills that develop them personally and professionally. Clintoy operations around the world observe policies, practices and processes to ensure compliance to all laws, regulations and accepted local and international industry standards relating to safety and hygiene, and other aspects of the workplace environment.  Safety Offices are nominated in all Clintoy locations and are responsible for conducting safety training on a regular basis. In 2016, hundreds of hours of safety training were conducted around the world with attendance by over 90% of employees. Accidents are monitored at all locations and corrective action taken where required.  There have been no fatalities at Clintoy services locations. Clintoy employees receive formal feedback twice per year in a 280-degree process in which both managers and peers provide feedback both via the internet and in performance development conversations. Training and development plans use these reviews to assist employees to develop their level of competence and discuss their concerns and expectations. Clintoy runs training programs for all employees relative to their on‐the‐job skill requirements and personal development needs. Involvement in the community – empowering and supporting local people Clintoy believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and socially sensitive employer in every community in the countries in which it operates. To accomplish this, Clintoy encourages each of its operating facilities to become actively involved in the life of the community by participating in and sponsoring initiatives that result in the advancement of community needs and in the betterment of the quality of life of the communities in which employees live. Clintoy main involvement to date has been in the area of supporting educational programs for disadvantaged youth.  2. Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses: The scope of our Business Integrity Management System includes reporting and investigation of human rights abuses. Clintoy ensures that the Company is not complicit in human rights abuses through its strict adherence to the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code for all its supply operations. The fact that Clintoy supply chain is vertically controlled means that Clintoy has minimal exposure to the actions of third party outsourcing suppliers. In all other respects, Clintoy makes efforts to ensure all suppliers operate both legally and ethically and avoid any form of human rights abuses. The way in which Clintoy deals with all business partners and suppliers, to ensure non complicity, is prescribed in Clintoy Code of Conduct, as follows:           The company does not knowingly do business with suppliers who:    Operate in violation of applicable law or regulation, including local environment, employment and safety laws.    Employ anyone who is under the legal age of employment as defined by the United Nations standards or by national standards, whichever are higher.   Clintoy seeks business partners who:    Share Clintoy commitment to product quality and to maintaining the operating practices necessary to meet its    quality standards.    Comply with all applicable legal standards and requirements of the country in which they are doing business and adhere to their national laws regarding protection and preservation of the environment.    Are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace and to treating employees fairly and in full compliance with local laws. While Clintoy recognizes that cultural differences exist and standards may vary by country, it expects its partners to adhere to the following:    Health and safety standards must meet, or exceed, all local laws and safety regulations.    Workers housing, where provided as a benefit of employment, must meet the same standards for health and safety as the workplace.    Provide wages and benefits that comply with any applicable law and the prevailing local, manufacturing industry practice, whichever is higher.    Provide each employee a clear, written accounting for every pay period; and do not deduct from employee pay for disciplinary infractions.   Comply with legally mandated work hours use overtime only when every employee is fully compensated according to local law inform every employee upon hiring if mandatory overtime is a condition of employment on a regularly scheduled basis provide one day off in seven and require no more than 60 hours of work per week on a regularly scheduled basis or comply with local limits if they are lower.    Do not use corporal punishment or other forms of mental or physical coercion.    Do not discriminate employees because of personal characteristics or beliefs.    Do not use forced labour or indentured servitude, including imprisonment or other compulsory labour regardless of whether such practices are permitted by applicable law.    Maintain on file all documentation needed to demonstrate compliance with this Code of Conduct and required laws; agree to make these documents available for Clintoy or its designated monitor; and agree to submit to inspections with or without prior notice.   3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the core value of freedom specifically includes our support for freedom of association, speech, thought and action, while recognizing the business framework in which the Clintoy operates. In the Nigeria, where approximately 43% of our employee population is based there is a legal requirement to have a Works Council.      This council actively engages with management on policies and is currently investigating expanding to include an international component. All our colleagues are free to make their own decisions whether or not to join a trade union and Clintoy is keen to ensure all colleagues are treated equally irrespective of whether they are a trade union member or not. Consequently we do not have a formal freedom of association policy as this is normal practice in our business.  There are two main trade unions; the Communication Workers Union and Unite. Union representation is found in all levels of business activity from pay negotiations to active participation in the Joint Working Group on Health and Safety and representation on the Carbon Management Board. Consultation with trade unions is a matter of respect and good business practice. Clintoy assist the unions to carry out their roles by providing them with  These include offices, IT equipment, notice boards; time allocated for union and committee meetings, collection of union dues through our payroll system and paid time to conduct union duties such as inspections, appeals and/or annual meetings.   Clintoy provides full time release for union members to undertake roles in, for example, health and safety. In accordance with our legal requirement Clintoy has established Health and Safety Committees in each of our operational areas. Meeting on a quarterly basis the union area health and safety representatives as part of the committee keep the measures taken to ensure the health and safety of our colleagues under review.   By working in synergy with the trade unions to establish best practice Clintoy will continue to comply with the true spirit of the Principle. Compliance with these Standards is a condition for becoming, and remaining, a business partner of Clintoy and is agreed to, in writing, as a term of engagement. Clintoy facilitates effective monitoring and enforcement, and our business partners are expected to provide full access to their production facilities and to relevant records relating to employment practices.   The Company undertakes affirmative measures, such as on‐site inspections of facilities, to implement and monitor these standards. The company exercises diligence to determine whether suppliers conform to these standards. Clintoy takes appropriate actions, including termination of its relationship, with any business partner violating its standards.  4. The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; The Clintoy Code of Business Principles specifically states that our company policy upholds the international conventions of labour standards, including those on child and forced labour. Clintoy Sustainable Development Charter commits our suppliers to comply with the International Labour Organisations (ILO) standards including eliminating forced and compulsory labour. By introducing clear and unambiguous ethical standards against which our suppliers are audited Clintoy is determined to uphold this Principle.      As part of our Responsible Procurement Policy Clintoy International Nigeria Limited expects our suppliers to ensure working hours of employees comply with national laws and industry specific regulations Prohibit forced, bonded or compulsory labour so that employees are free to leave their employment after reasonable notice.   Clintoy has developed a robust procurement CSR Audit whereby all suppliers must confirm that they have read and understood Clintoy Responsible Procurement Policy and more importantly they agree to the standards and procedures set out in the policy. Specific questions are asked in the in relation to this Principle with supporting documentation required to support the supplier’s response.  All colleagues working for Clintoy do a voluntary basis and are free to leave after the agreed or contractual notice period. This Principle is actively supported by Clintoy and we will continue to explore ways we can help and support all our customers and suppliers eliminate this from the  5. The effective abolition of child labour; As part of our recruitment process all applicants are required to provide at the time of interview a means of identification such as a Birth Certificate or Passport. Either or both of these documents do provide proof, so far as is reasonably practicable the holder’s age. Any person identified as being under the minimum legal age for employment or for employment in hazardous work will not be offered employment. Similar to Principle 4 Clintoy as part of our Responsible Procurement Policy expects our suppliers to:     Ensure no person is employed who is below the minimum legal age for employment    Ensure no person under 18 years of age is employed for any hazardous work   For products and services manufactured or provided from low cost countries where the risk of child labour is higher, Clintoy requires the vendor to complete a CSR self-assessment clearly stating that child labour shall not be used. Additionally this will form part of all audits carried  6.  The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and Occupation; our company policy does not tolerate discrimination. The majority of our staff is covered by a formal program against discrimination. Furthermore, we believe that diversity in staff promotes innovation and more comprehensive solutions. Our diversity encompasses differences in nationalities, ethnic background, gender, language, age and experience. Clintoy is firmly committed to providing and promoting equality of opportunity for all existing and prospective employees and agents. To achieve this we have created an environment in which there is respect for every individual and recognition of their aspirations, regardless of their race, colour, creed, ethnic or national origins, gender, marital or family status, sexuality, disability or age.        Trade Union participation is actively encouraged with direct lines of communication through well-established means diversity is of immense importance to Clintoy, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because people who feel valued will be more motivated and committed in helping Clintoy to achieve and exceed its goals.  Bullying and harassment is one area Clintoy is determined to tackle. To help eradicate all colleagues have access to a Bullying and Harassment Helpline. The bullying and harassment helpline offers confidential advice and support to our people if they feel they are being bullied or harassed at work its primary purpose being to  Other initiatives include a national “Ban Bullying Day” which is used to raise awareness of workplace bullying. We also have “Have Your Say” surveys which amongst other business related questions, asks if they have been the recipient of bullying. The data provided by this survey is closely monitored by senior management.   7.  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; We actively promote taking a precautionary approach to environmental challenges in our projects in cooperation with our clients. This is a central point in our approach to business, as is illustrated in the performance and plans of our business groups and regions that are shared in our annual report. Clintoy strategy has been based upon the identification of our environmental impacts and their validation by external stakeholders. Clintoy has made a bold commitment to be carbon  Through the introduction of clearly defined policies and with the engagement of our colleagues we are making strong progress to achieve this goal with significant improvement to our carbon footprint. Clintoy recognizes the importance of protecting the environment as one of the key foundations of responsible business and is committed to the protection of the environment and its employees treat the protection of the environment as an integral factor in all business activities. To comply with this commitment,   Clintoy policy is to meet or exceed all relevant legal requirements. Clintoy endeavours to work closely with suppliers, government bodies, environmental groups and local communities to promote sustainability of the raw materials it uses. Since dyeing and finishing involves chemical processes that can have a significant impact on the environment, Clintoy ensures that services the Company uses meet the highest standards by conducting independent tests on finished.   Clintoy adheres to a strict code of practice to ensure that no materials, chemicals used in the production process of its services and present an unacceptable risk to health or to the environment during its manufacture, use or disposal and minimizes its workforce's exposure to toxic materials by handling chemicals according to high industrial hygiene standards and safe working practices and procedures.      Employees are required to report all incidents in which toxic substances are spilled or released into the environment. All Clintoy employees are aware that violations of environmental laws, even if unintentional, can carry severe penalties and could result in prosecution or liability of Clintoy International Limited, the employees involved, or both. Clintoy key policy approaches are as follows:     Strict adherence to all laws and regulations relating to environmental matters at all Clintoy facilities in Israel and abroad.    Minimizing Clintoy impact through advanced use of eco‐driven technology.    Reducing consumption, recycling and reusing wherever possible.    Ensuring awareness of all employees regarding environmental practices.   Clintoy Environmental Policy and Practices fall within the responsibility of the Global Development and Marketing Director, a member of the Company's most senior leadership team reporting to the CEO.   8. Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; In our own operations, we have increased focus on environmental aspects. In 2017 we set the target of a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions per FTE vs. 2014 and committed to compensating to a climate neutral position first in the Nigeria for 2016 and for our global operations in 2017.   The Clintoy signed the Copenhagen Communiqué and joined a small group of business leaders to call on the Dutch government to cut CO2 emissions by investing in clean energy, cleaner transportation, sustainable building techniques and new technologies.   Clintoy makes efforts to reduce consumption of energy and materials, and reduce the Company overall carbon footprint. This is highly developed as part of Clintoy eco-technology advances as has been detailed above.   In other aspects of Clintoy operations and acts to install an environmental sensitivity and consciousness in employees and provides frameworks for them to improve environmental impacts in their work. Our employees have been issued with a Green Family handbook which also assists them in applying green habits in their home life.   The main objective of the programme is to engage and inspire our people to think about energy efficiency and collectively make on-going and sustained improvements through our individual actions. An initial scoping study will identify existing good practice across the company as well as suggesting new areas to target. We'll then be in a position to start providing technical solutions to reduce our carbon footprint.         We have already undertaken energy surveys across our company and the results being used in the carbon management programme. We have exceeded our target for the procurement of renewable electricity with 100% of our electricity in Nigeria coming from certified renewable sources (such as wind, wave, biomass) As per the latest DEFRA guidelines we will not be claiming CO2 reductions with the use of energy from those sources, because the contracted arrangements with our energy supplier do not include the facilities for the retirement of Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs).   We have run a series of energy pilots across the whole Company portfolio ran from January 2008 to March 2016, in partnership with Energy Company, who will receive a proportion of any savings made through the pilot. The sites were allowed to use various methods to reduce energy usage some usual the technological approach and others using housekeeping methods. Following positive feedback a national rollout has been developed.   The roll out will help managers and employees in Clintoy sites to reduce their impact on the environment, leading to a reduction in costs. They will be able to identify their impact on the environment for their unit and be able to use tools provided to control those impacts. In easy to understand terms the managers will have tools to enable them to know how and why they need to manage the elements of Gas, Electricity, Lighting, Water and Waste on their sites including housekeeping. Our employees are encouraged not to make waste through our Reduce, Reuse and Recycle Scheme which is explained below.   The first stage is to minimise the amount of waste generated which can be done through a number of initiatives (i.e. education, awareness). This tackles the problem of waste at the heart because by reducing the amount we create it means the less we have to deal with for recycling and reusing. By reducing the amount of waste we generate we will be helping the environment and easing the pressure on the landfill sites around the country.   The second stage is the reusing of material that aims to prevent waste being disposed at landfill sites. There are many ways items of “waste” can be reused; an item judged to be “unwanted” by one person may be needed by another. You could simply return items back to source e.g. if operationally feasible York labels and bag labels may be able to be collected and returned to  Recycle  The third stage is to recycle any material that is unable to be reused; this type of material is often in the form of cardboard, paper, cans, plastics, glass and textiles. Recycling services are available throughout the Nigeria Recycling waste reduces the need for landfill, saves the earth's resources as well as reducing energy use.       9. Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies;  A Fuel and Transport Strategy Group has been formed to progress the decision make around alternative fuel vehicles. The group made up of representatives from the individual business units, vehicle services and Group. The Clintoy is currently focusing on gathering as much data as possible around the alternative fuel market and this is being match by internal data such the average daily vehicle mileages and replacement timescales for the fleet. A small number of alternative fuel vehicles are currently under test to evaluate their performance and any driver interface issues. Zero carbon buildings as a target.   10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery The Clintoy has a zero tolerance policy toward corruption, bribery, collusion, extortion, fraud and other forms of improper actions for corporate or personal financial gain. This also applies to actions by our business partners. Security within Clintoy is to Secure and Reinforce our Best and Most Trusted Status. The Security Team is dedicated to creating and maintaining a secure environment for Clintoy staff, customers and customer assets. Whilst there are clearly some absolutes, the definition of a secure environment is inform to a significant extent by the appetite for risk of a number of key stakeholders, in particular:      Our customers, both commercial and social    Clintoy and Clintoy CEO Business leaders    Our frontline colleagues and their unions   The Security Strategy has 7 key themes, all of which consistently support the Prevention-Deterrence-Disruption-Detection model as shown below.     Data Quality, Access & Management    Understanding & Modelling Security Risk    Proactive Intervention    Control & Compliance Initiatives    Communication, Awareness and Engagement    Investigation & Recoveries   Clintoy work directly with clients and support Sales & Marketing to deliver expert advice. Clintoy also provide security input to tender bids, bespoke solutions and new products ensuring that security risks are factored in and helping to meet the needs of our clients.   Clintoy specialist team manages the security relationship direct with our security counterparts and supporting Key Account Managers and Partnership Directors when clients require. A clear demonstration of how Clintoy takes our clients' concerns about security of their services seriously and that we take action when things go wrong.      We measure our effectiveness through internal and external Customer Satisfaction Surveys and against customer retention. As part of our Responsible Procurement Policy Clintoy International Nigeria Limited expects our suppliers to:     Prevent unfair, unreasonable and unethical business practices    Prevent the use of any form of bribery or improper offer of payment to or from  Clintoy has adopted a Procurement Probity Policy which provides guidelines for our employees and seeks to ensure that dealings with suppliers are entirely ethical and above board. Additionally we have set up a confidential helpline to enable colleagues to report any crime or suspected crime against Clintoy.    I would like to extend my gratitude to our esteemed shareholders for their continuous support, and their confidence in Management and the Board of directors. I assure you that we will continuously strive to keep Clintoy on the path of growth.

COP 2016 
 
 
 
 
During 2016, SRS has continued to engaged in Q-net, a Swedish association for women in the 
security industry and have by now a representative in the board.   
 
Outcome 
 
At the end of 2016, 26% of SRS employees were women. 25% of those carrying staff liability at SRS 
were women. The male part of the workforce received 8% higher pay on an average which is a 
positive trend from previous years even though it is not a satisfying result. 
 
ENVIRONMENT 
- Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges (P7). 
- Undertake initiatives to greater environmental responsibility (P8). 
- Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies (P9).  
 
Overview 
 
Our environmental impact is assessed to be relatively small, considering being a services company. 
Therefore, the environmental issue is not our main focus within the UN Global Compact. Our main 
impact is probably our travel by flight.  
 
Performance indicators and practical actions 
 
The following actions have been taken to decrease SRS environmental impact 
 

  Only green electricity at the office. 
  Foodstuff and office supplies that are purchased for the office are organically produced 

when organically products are available. 

  SRS has implemented a waste separation concept during the year.  
  SRS do not climate compensate flights as the Swedish government doesn’t fully support the 
method i.e. tax reducing initiatives. Until the Swedish government changes their policy SRS 
has decided to contribute in other areas.   
 

Outcome 
 
146 kilos of paper were used for printing, a reduction from previous years. 25058 kWh electricity 
was used at the office, an increase from previous years due to an increased number of employees. A 
total of 1065869 miles were flown. This is an increase from previous year by 470734 miles due to 
expanded international projects.

In 2016, Lundin Mining joined the UN Global Compact. Our corporate values and guiding principles align 
well with the Global Compact’s ten principles on human rights, labour, the environment and anti‐

Description of Actions 
HUMAN RIGHTS 

Principle 1: Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed 
human rights 
Principle 2: Make sure the organization is not complicit in human rights abuses 

 
Lundin respects human rights as set forth in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and integrates human rights into its business practices and processes. The Company also fosters a work 
environment free from discrimination against gender, age, race, national origin, marital status, sexual 
orientation, religious beliefs, disability, or any other personal characteristics protected by international 
human rights law.  
 
Assessment, policy and goals 
Lundin’s position on and approach to the protection of human rights is guided by the following Lundin 
Mining corporate policies, principles, standards and/or commitments:  

  Code of Conduct, Ethical Values and Anti‐Corruption (the “Code”) 

The recognition of, and respect for, human rights is an essential component of the Company’s 
conduct and ethical values and underlies our commitment to ethical business conduct and 
corporate social responsibility wherever we operate 
 

  Responsible Mining Policy 

  Our Policy includes commitments to: conduct our business activities ethically and transparently; 
treat people with dignity and respect human rights as set forth in the United Nations Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights; and respect and take into consideration the rights, interests, 
concerns, traditional land uses and cultural activities of Indigenous peoples within our sphere of 
influence. 

 

  Responsible Mining Framework 

Responsible Mining is dependent on conducting activities in accordance with recognized 
standards for respect of Indigenous & human rights. One of the five Responsible Mining 
Framework elements – social – ensures that formal systems are in place to uphold fundamental 
human rights. 
 

  Social Impact Management Standard 

This standard ensures that formal systems are in place to ensure we consistently demonstrate 
respect for human rights 

In addition to the UN Global Compact, Lundin demonstrates its commitment to support human rights 
through voluntary alignment with the following international principles/standards:  

  OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) 
  United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  
  Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs) 

 
Implementation 
Concrete actions taken by Lundin to implement human rights policies, address human rights risks and 
respond to human rights violations include:  

  Training on policy/procedures including ethics and harassment 
  A line of communication (i.e. 24 hour hotline, independent website, and courier service) for the 
confidential reporting and investigation of any behavior which violates policies identified in the 
Code, including human rights 

  Processes in place at each operation to receive and address questions, concerns and formal 

grievances from third parties. The characteristics of these grievance mechanisms varies across 
our operations, and all ensure that our stakeholders have a formal avenue to voice concerns and 
can expect a fair process where their feedback is heard and complaints are addressed. We 
receive, document, track, and respond to questions or concerns raised by stakeholders both 
informally and formally, and are working to align these processes with international standards.  
 

Measurement of outcomes 
Lundin monitors and evaluates performance on the issue of human rights by way of: 

  Employee performance reviews conducted annually or in some offices and operations on a 

twice yearly or quarterly basis at the supervisory, management, and executive positions. 
Reviews focus on corporate goals and individual objectives, including human rights. 

  We have systems in place at all of our sites where communities can provide feedback, 

comments or complaints on any area of interest or concern to them, including human rights‐
related issues. Data and information on grievances filed and resolved within the reporting 
period can be found in our sustainability report. No human rights‐related grievances were filed 
in 2016. 
 
LABOUR 

Principle 3: Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the 
right to collective bargaining 
Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour 
Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour 
Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 

 

Lundin is committed to achieving a safe, productive and healthy work environment across all operations. 
The Company supports freedom of association and collective bargaining, does not tolerate any form of 
harassment and fosters a work environment free from discrimination. We support the elimination of all 
forms of forced and compulsory labour, and child labour; based on our internal assessment, none of our 
operations are at risk for incidents of child labour, or forced or compulsory labour.  

Assessment, policy and goals 
Lundin’s position on labour is guided by the following policies, principles, standards and/or

unacceptable. The Company is committed to meeting or exceeding legal requirements wherever we 
operate.

Conflict  of  minerals  is  one  of  the  most  problem  of  the  companies.  Tin,  volfram, 
Tantalum,  Gold  such  elements  are  produced  in  small  and  illegal  mines  of  the  Democratic 
Republic of Congo where the civil war is still continuing also in this places there is still child  
and forced labored. This is also an outcome of the civil war which ongoing 10 year civil war. 
After the shaping of the Dodd Frank code section 1502 in 2012 the conflict of minerals become 
importance. After shaping of this code the companies had to declare from where they did buy 
these materials. Are they using these materials from the Democratic Congo Republic or even 
from the neighbor countries? After this the companies had to declare from where they bought 
these materials while this is contributing for human rights violations.  

 

According to these new regulations Mesa Makina is working in cooperation with its 
 
suppliers  that  they  are  not  using  3TG  materials.  First  fully  starting  from  our  raw  material 
suppliers  and  our  sub  suppliers  we  are  taking  and  using  Conflict  of  Minerals  Reporting 
Templates (CMRT).

We are giving importance to the human health and environment according to that we 
are every time the materials which are produced in accordance to the prohibited materials

materials.  
 

3.  ENVIRONMENT 

 
While  the  responding  growing  needs  and  other  side  production  processes,  using 
product and services effects to environment must be decreased,   todays primary liability of

conduct for suppliers

Introduction

Vattenfall provides energy for today’s society and contributes to
the energy system of tomorrow. We are committed to conducting
our business activities in full compliance with applicable laws, rules
and regulations and strive at continuously improving our social and
environmental performance throughout our entire value chain.

We take responsibility for our actions and we expect our suppliers
to do the same.

This Code of Conduct for Suppliers defines our basic requirements
in the area of human rights and working conditions, the environment
and business integrity. It is based on the UN Global Compact which 
Vattenfall signed as a participant in 2008. Vattenfall expects its 
suppliers to implement the principles described in this Code of 
Conduct for Suppliers in their own businesses or have at least
equivalent standards adopted and conduct their business in 
accordance therewith.

Vattenfall will continuously monitor suppliers’ compliance with the
standards set out in this Code of Conduct for Suppliers by asking
suppliers to provide relevant information and also by conducting
supplier audits and reviews.

Code of Conduct for Suppliers · March 2017

Page 2

1    Vattenfall’s code of conduct for suppliers 
1.1 General

Vattenfall’s Code of Conduct for Suppliers (hereafter 
called ‘the Vattenfall Code’) sets requirements for 
suppliers and is based on the UN Global Compact, 
the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human 
Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises as well as other international standards, 
norms and guidelines (see ‘References’ for a full list). 

Vattenfall requires its suppliers to comply with the 
Vattenfall Code or an equivalent standard, agreed 
together with Vattenfall, when doing business with 
Vattenfall.

1.2 Compliance with laws and regulations
Vattenfall’s suppliers shall comply with all applicable 
laws, rules and regulations in the countries where 
they operate. Vattenfall expects suppliers to 
meet the more stringent requirements between 
the Vattenfall Code and applicable laws and 
regulations and to work with their own suppliers and 
subcontractors towards that goal.

In case of contradictions between the Vattenfall 
Code and applicable laws and regulations Vattenfall 
expects the supplier to inform Vattenfall. 

1.3 Commitment to continuous improvement
Vattenfall recognizes that suppliers will be at 
different stages of maturity and commits to working 
with suppliers to achieve continuous improvement. 

If Vattenfall finds that a supplier is not meeting 
the requirements and expectations set out in this 
Code of Conduct for Suppliers, Vattenfall may 
offer guidance specifying which issues need to be 
corrected or improved. The supplier should then take 
corrective actions promptly and commit to showing 
progress. 

Vattenfall also encourages suppliers to participate in 
initiatives aiming to raise the standard of an entire 
sector or across sectors, where applicable.

1.4 Consequences in case of violations
Suppliers shall address any violations of the 
Vattenfall Code or equivalent standards that come 

to their knowledge and to take appropriate actions. 
Depending on the severity of the violation appropriate 
actions could be a request for corrective measures. 
Persistent failure to comply with the Vattenfall Code 
or repeated and unjustified refusal to provide the 
required information may also result in suspending or 
terminating the suppliers activities with Vattenfall.

1.5 Due diligence and transparency

1.5.1 General
Vattenfall shall have the right to conduct due 
diligence by regularly and systematically identifying 
and assessing human and labour rights, environment 
and business ethics related risks and impacts in its 
supply chain and to use this information to avoid 
or mitigate the impacts in order to ensure that it 
sources responsibly. 

Vattenfall expects suppliers to allow Vattenfall, or a 
third party authorised by Vattenfall and reasonably 
acceptable to the supplier, to conduct audits and 
assessments of the supplier’s operations relevant 
for the Vattenfall Code, including but not limited to 
the supplier’s facilities. At the supplier’s request, 
the parties involved in any such audit shall enter 
into a confidentiality agreement regarding the 
circumstances disclosed in the audit or  
assessment.

Vattenfall also expects its suppliers to conduct

megatrends. The company responds to these trends with a broad range of products for various 
markets; amongst others, with the development of products and solutions in the field of 
renewable energies in response to the growing shortage of resources. A number of product 
examples demonstrating this will be highlighted in the following:

Intelligent photovoltaic panel shutdown 
Phoenix Contact has been involved in the field of renewable energies for a long time. Photovoltaic 
systems have become a significant and established part of energy supply, with an installed power so 
far of approximately 230 gigawatts worldwide. Roughly two thirds of these systems are installed on 
building roofs. It must be just as easy and safe to maintain and repair these PV applications as it is 
to operate them. To this end, thanks to the intelligent SOLARCHECK RSD panel shutdown system, 
these systems can be automatically disconnected without expert knowledge.
According to the latest studies, the feed-in power of PV systems worldwide will increase to 
approximately 600 gigawatts by 2020. This comparatively small and yet very important portion  
of the energy mix contributes to limiting climate change and to the sustainable management of  
the available energy reserves. Above all, growth in industrial and municipal applications emphasizes 
the significance of photovoltaics as a credible element of the energy balance in buildings and 
operations.
This trend is aided by the simplicity of use of these PV applications. As opposed to other energy 
suppliers, the use of combustible fuel is not necessary, there are no moving parts, and installation 
and wiring are very easy to realize. Indeed, annual maintenance, the occasional repairs necessary 
due to damage caused by external influences, and cleaning in order to improve yields are normally 
the only times that the operator needs to have physical contact with his PV system. Otherwise, the 
system normally produces electricity reliably and requires no further involvement.
The power range of such systems is between 30 and 500 kilowatts. The PV panels in these 
systems are connected in series and then connected together to the inverter inputs. Through this 
type of wiring, and depending on the number of panels, the system voltage summates to between 
several hundred volts up to one kilovolt. DC electricity is present on this side of the PV system; 
AC electricity for feed-in or other purposes is only present downstream of the inverter.
Since all system components have been designed as standard for long-term operation under the 
influence of weather, the safety of the photovoltaic system is normally also assured. This means 
that all parts are insulated appropriately and do not therefore represent a danger to people 

PHOENIX CONTACT    5  

or animals. Nevertheless, each 
PV application is a real power 
station. In particular during repairs, 
operators and technicians must be 
careful, for example of insulation 
errors. Physical harm can, however, 
be fully avoided if the panels on the 
DC side are disconnected. If this is 
the case, high voltages cannot be 
generated and the technician can 
work in conditions of complete 
safety.
Many PV systems have a central 
disconnect point, further 
disconnect points at the entrance 
to the roof or various passive 
protective measures, such as 
fireproof cable ducts. None of these 
activities, however, address the 
cause of the danger. Activating the 
disconnection device only interrupts 
the flow of current; the high voltage 

remains in the system as long as sunlight falls on the PV system. Even the well-known and, from 
experience, expedient five safety rules cannot be followed with this DC-side solution because 
disconnection from voltage sources is not possible. The only proven procedure is the individual 
disconnection of the PV panels. In this way, high system voltages simply cannot be generated.
In terms of equipping the photovoltaic system, this does however mean that each PV panel 
needs a switching device, which increases the costs accordingly. An argument here in favor of 
investment costs and against occupational safety is not only inappropriate, but also irresponsible. 
In order that the attractiveness of PV systems is not reduced, the safety disconnection equipment 
does however need to be manageable in terms of costs and, above all, be beneficial. To this 
end, Phoenix Contact has developed an intelligent panel disconnection system that protects 
everybody involved in the photovoltaic system without them having to have special expert 
knowledge. The SOLARCHECK RSD system includes two device types which automatically 
and fully disconnect and then later reconnect the system. Each of the switching units, which 
are installed directly behind the individual panels, react individually and recognize when the 
system is behaving abnormally. Such a reaction is judged to be unsafe operation and the panels 
are then disconnected. Because Solarcheck RSD also recognizes inverter disconnection as 
being a deviation, the entire system can also be disconnected manually. In the event of cleaning, 
maintenance or repair, the operator or technician can thus disconnect the entire DC-side of the 
PV system by disconnecting the inverter. 
The often discussed subject of first responders is also safely covered, without the necessity  
of having specialists on site. One of the first measures here includes disconnecting the building  
at the main fuse or even disconnecting an entire block at the main distribution box. Such  
steps lead to the standard-compliant disconnection of the DC side of the inverter and thus  
all PV panels. 
The most critical scenario in the event of a fire involving a building with a PV system does not 
lie in extinguishing the fire, but rather in repairs and the removal of fire-damaged parts. In this 
case, it must be assumed that cables are damaged or have melted together. Thus, the technician 
is presented with a situation that is difficult to estimate. If, however, he has disconnected all 
panels individually via Solarcheck RSD, resulting in the system not being in normal operation, the 
technician can also work safely in such extreme cases. Reconnection of the photovoltaic system 
is also fully automatic under controlled conditions. This ensures that the system does not start 
up again as long as work is being performed on it. The starter unit with intelligent test programs 
equipped especially for this purpose only allows the energy to flow again when the array is 

PHOENIX CONTACT    6  

not interrupted and the inverter has been connected and released. This rules out inadvertent 
reconnection. 
With Solarcheck RSD, Phoenix Contact provides a solution that is exclusively for safe 
disconnection. This system has therefore been designed to be appropriately robust and simple. 
No additional cabling, configuring or special commissioning is necessary for its installation. The 
devices are designed for long-term use under harsh conditions and therefore only contain high-
quality components. They are not limited to certain inverters or PV panel types. It is thus ensured 
that the safety function can be installed in all standard crystalline photovoltaic systems, regardless 
of other components. 

Load optimization in wind turbine generators
Wind turbine generators are designed for a service life of 20 years. But what happens then? 
Normally, the systems are dismantled and, wherever possible, sold on. They are then very often 
relocated to Eastern European countries, where they reliably generate electricity for many more 
years. This begs the question as to why these systems do not remain on the grid in Germany for 
longer.
Countless operators argue in favor of a longer-term operating life for wind turbine generators 
(WTGs). This is because the wind turbines are installed at sites that do not allow repowering, 
or the financial means for a new system are not available to the operator at that point in time. 
WTGs are not developed for a specific number of years. Rather, their primary components are 
designed for specific loads. During the development of wind turbine generators, the manufacturers 
calculate the loads in a way that the wind turbine generators are capable of operating for at 
least 20 years even in locations that are subject to particularly strong winds. As a consequence, 
systems - particularly those that are installed inland in less windy locations - often have a relatively 
high reserve in practice between the load assumption determined during development and the 

actual value resulting from the 
operating life. 
The challenge confronting 
operators during an application 
for an operating period extension 
is proving the structural stability 
beyond the planned operating 
period. A surveyor, and in the 
best case the system manufacturer 
data regarding the exact design 
of the WTG, are necessary for 
such confirmation. Using all of the 
data available, the surveyor then 
examines whether the structural 
stability is assured beyond the 
approved operating lifetime. Much 
of the information necessary is 
very difficult to determine and can 
only be calculated via interpolation. 
Thus, the surveyors often have 
to refer to wind field analyses 
and wind data from the system 
control, for example, in order to 
be able to estimate the load on the 
components during their lifetime 
so far. This data is, in most cases, 
inaccurate or incomplete and 
must therefore be overlaid with 
an appropriate risk factor. For the 

PHOENIX CONTACT    7  

exact determination of a possible 
operating period extension, it is 
therefore advantageous if the exact 
load data recorded over as long a 
time period as possible is available. 
Ideally, a wind turbine generator 
that is intended for further use 
should be equipped with a load 
measurement system from the 
point of commissioning. If this 
is not the case, the immediate 
retrofitting of such a load 
measurement system is expedient. 
This enables as much reliable data 
to be collected as possible, based 
on which the surveyor can create 
a significantly more exact forecast 
as to how long the wind turbine 
generator may remain on the grid. 
In order to utilize the absolute load 
limit of the wind turbine generator, 

the operator should still have the load measurement system installed even if the extension to 
the operating period has already been granted. In this way, it is possible to determine precisely 
the extent to which the loads assumed for the extended service life have been exceeded or not 
reached. The operator can now decide whether to decommission his system early or to further 
prolong the extended operating period.
It is now the case that as a part of some approvals for extended operation, continuous monitoring 
of the loads is demanded explicitly. Currently, there are very few systems available on the market 
with which the loads of a wind turbine generator can be reliably measured. The Phoenix Contact 
Rotor Blade Tension Monitoring System (RBTM) is one of the first solutions in this field.
The RBTM system can be fully integrated into new wind turbine generators and retrofitted into 
existing WTGs. These products are very quick to install and replace, and the expenditure for this 
is relatively low. 
With this solution, the loads arising in the blade root are recorded, preprocessed, and transmitted 
to a superordinate system, and defined actions are taken autonomously. Alongside the general 
vibration analysis, the RBTM enables the determination of load spectrums, which simplify the 
estimation of the remaining service life. 
If the data regarding the loads on the rotor blades in a WTG is recorded, the process of approval 
for further operation is simplified significantly. The load measurements can furthermore be used 
to optimize the operation of the wind turbine generator and to ensure the longest possible 
period of further operation. Older systems whose locations are not suitable for repowering can 
be utilized for the maximum service life of the components in this way.

Growth of E-Mobility in the Netherlands
E-Mobility will only become accepted once the vehicle can be charged rapidly anywhere. Along 
with Phoenix Contact and ABB, Fastned is contributing to this vision slowly but surely becoming a 
reality in the Netherlands. 
""In the foreseeable future, you will be able to cover a distance of 400 kilometers with an electric 
car on just one charge. This does away with the need for charging in your home garage. Rather, 
vehicles will be recharged at work or on the motorway"", says Crijn Bouman, Vice President 
of Business Development at ABB Electrical Vehicle & Charging Infrastructure. Today, the Swiss 
concern is one of the leading providers of Internet-based charging infrastructure. The charging 
stations have a cloud link based on open standards, enabling them to be connected to all service 
and payment applications. Furthermore, they are equipped with all relevant rapid charging plugs, 
enabling all E-vehicles to be charged. 
The business relationship between today's ABB Electrical Vehicle division and Phoenix Contact 
stretches back to 2010. ""Back then, we took up a pioneering role in E-Mobility together 
with Phoenix Contact"", remembers Bouman. ""Both companies were represented within the 
commission that defined the European rapid charging standard CSS (Combined Charging System). 
The foundation was laid during this period for intensive cooperation, within the framework of 
which, for example, we had a two-way exchange on the subject of ergonomics. The first few years 
were taken up with the development of prototypes. Currently, the E-Mobility sector is growing 
continuously. Among other things, a new generation of charging plugs is currently being designed 
which will enable even more power to be conducted"". 
A good example of how dynamically the market is expanding is, according to Bouman, the growth 
of the rapid charging network in the Netherlands. The stock market-listed Fastned company 
is commissioning new charging stations every week, for example. Established in 2011, Fastned 
received the concession in 2012 for building rapid charging units at 201 freeway service stations. 
Approximately 130 stations are due to be in operation by the end of 2017. This is necessary 
because the Dutch government has resolved that by 2020, 2.5 percent and by 2025, 12.5 percent 
of the approximately eight million licensed cars are to be electrically powered. And because the 

motorists do not want to relinquish 
the familiar convenience of 
conventional vehicles, the E-vehicle 
batteries need to be able to be 
recharged in a very short period 
of time.
Set to this background, in the 
summer of 2013 Fastned awarded 
ABB with the contract for providing 
suitable charging stations, with 
which the electric vehicles can be 
charged within 15 to 20 minutes 
for a range of 150 kilometers. For 
this, ABB uses Phoenix Contact 
CCS (Combined Charging System) 
charging plugs. Furthermore, the 
stations include type 2 AC plugs 
in accordance with IEC 62196 
for conventional charging with 
AC power and CHAdeMO plugs 
(Charge for Moving). 
The Combined Charging System 
(CCS) was developed by the 
German and American automotive 
industries in cooperation with 
Phoenix Contact. The aim was to 

PHOENIX CONTACT    9  

standardize the charging interface 
between the vehicle and the 
charging station. At the same time, 
both the established AC charging 
and the much faster DC charging 
was to be possible. The result 
is the now-widespread ""type 2 
combined interface"" with just one 
plug-in contact on the E-vehicle, 
via which it can be charged at both 
AC and DC stations. Thus, users 
can either charge their electric 
vehicles with alternating current 
conventionally over night in their 
garage, or on longer stopovers 
in car parks. Furthermore, rapid charging in just a few minutes at service stations, restaurants, 
supermarkets and banks is also possible. Naturally, safety measures are also built in; on the one 
hand, an electromechanical interlock actuator, and, on the other hand, monitoring of the charging 
current in the event of the system overheating. 
The Fastned charging stations are easily recognizable thanks to their design. The prominent roof 
does not just offer protection in the event of bad weather, but is also equipped with solar panels. 
Indeed, the energy provided by Fastned for charging electric vehicles is generated entirely by wind 
and solar power. Battery storage systems at the individual stations buffer the energy generated 
for those times when the sun is not sufficient or there is little wind. There are at least two rapid 
charging points per station in order to minimize longer queuing times. Furthermore, customers 
have access to a Wi-Fi network. Thus, for example, they can read their e-mails, prepare meetings, 
listen to music or even watch TV while their vehicle is charging. Fastned is certain that the faster 
charging speed will also reduce the cost of charging. If hundreds of E-vehicles can be charged per 
day, the higher financial expenditure for the hardware laid out by the company will be recovered 
more quickly. 
In order that this technological position is maintained, ABB continues to work closely together 
with Phoenix Contact. Higher charging currents are in the planning phase that will enable the 
action radius, currently at 150 kilometers, to be extended to 300 to 500 kilometers once the 
battery performance improves. The value for rapid charging on the road amounts to a minimum 
of 100 to 350 kilowatts. Against this background, the heat balance of charging stations and 
connectors is of crucial importance. In this regard, Bouman asserts: ""There are only a few 
companies that are able to supply such a charging plug. Therefore, Phoenix Contact opens up a 
high level of added value to us in this environment"".

  Environment: Conservation of resources at Phoenix Contact

Phoenix Contact has focused on activities for increasing efficiency, environmentally responsible 
production and using environmentally friendly and sustainable building technology for many years:
""Environmental protection is an integral part of our corporate policy. A main focus of our activities is on 
taking responsibility for the sustained protection of our resources"".
The energy management system in accordance with DIN EN ISO 50001 ensures the necessary 
transparency and measurability of the steps implemented. The successful recertification in 2016 
accredited the measures implemented and highlighted further potentials for optimization. 

Energy efficiency training
A new course on offer is the training program ""Energy efficiency compact: possibilities for reducing 
the energy requirement"", aimed at those responsible for energy, employees who have an interest in 
the subjects of energy and energy efficiency, and those who are involved with energy during their 
activities within the company. Upon completion of the training program, the participants should be 
in a position to demonstrate methods for increasing energy efficiency within the company. They 
can develop their own ideas and measures aimed at reducing the energy requirements of the com-
pany. Furthermore, participants can identify the energy saving measures that Phoenix Contact has 
previously introduced and become acquainted with the contact persons in order to receive sup-
port on the subjects of energy and energy efficiency.

Construction of new office building
New energy efficient technologies and renewable energies are being installed at the Phoenix 
Contact sites wherever possible in order to ensure the optimum utilization and conservation 
of resources. In the construction of a new Phoenix Contact Electronics building, the technical 
highlight is the building automation. Many installations are barely visible to the employees or even 
not noticeable, and yet energy data, the lighting or occupancy of meeting rooms and corners can 
be displayed via a page on the intranet. Employees can see whether the ceiling mounted cooling 
systems are running, the value they are set to and whether there is a malfunction. In such cases, 
a message is sent via telephone to employees in Facility Management, who can immediately see 
what the malfunction is. Thus, any consequential damage is avoided. Energy data on the individ-
ual rooms, rotation speeds and consumption are displayed transparently and with progression 
curves in order that in the event of increasing energy consumption with no apparent explanation, 
the cause can be ascertained more quickly. Furthermore, a system has been installed which, in 
the event of a fire, blocks the ways to the location of the fire and guides employees out of the 
 building via the correct path. 

PHOENIX CONTACT    11  

The entire roof area of the 
new building has been equipped 
with a photovoltaic system that 
includes 670 panels covering an 
area of 935 square meters. In 
ideal solar irradiation conditions, 
the system can generate a power 
of 175,000 kilowatt hours per 
year, which is comparable with 
the average amount of energy 
consumed by 46 single family 
homes each with three people. 
The energy generated is exclu-
sively for in-house consumption. 
A storage system has also been 
installed so that a small amount 
of energy can be stored interme-
diately. The photovoltaic system 
also serves as a test system for 
products developed by Phoenix 
Contact. Among other products, 
Sunclix connectors, the Solarcheck 
system for efficiency monitoring 
and the intelligent disconnection 
of photovoltaic panels with Auto 
Rapid Shutdown (RSD) have been 
installed. The Solarcheck RSD sys-
tem and its scope of application 
are described in detail in the Econ-
omy section. 

The building is a perfect example of the possibilities of modern building technology. An intel-
ligent connection between the energy supply, heating and cooling circuits and the production 
areas enables the sustainable, energy efficient operation of the site. Due to the supply process, 
the building does not need heating and cooling systems. Interested customers can see and 
experience first hand how and where they can install Phoenix Contact products and what they 
can do. 
While designing the architecture of the building, great value was also placed on the possibilities 
for communication. There are the usual meeting rooms, closed off seating areas and shortcuts 
to the coffee rooms. The so-called plaza is also an ideal meeting point. 

PHOENIX CONTACT    12  

  Social responsibility: Commitment to our employees

Phoenix Contact attaches great importance to an appreciative and trustworthy corporate culture 
as well as to the development of employees. This is also specified in the corporate culture: 
""Our corporate culture promotes trust and employee development to achieve our agreed 
objectives"". The expectation of a mutually respectful appreciative environment is also reflected in 
management's mission statement, including aspects such as ""trust"", ""respect and appreciation"" and 
""promotion and development"".
The depth of the culture of the trust within the Phoenix 
Contact Group is measured every two years via the 
employee survey in association with the Great Place to 
Work Institute. Reports on individual results enable the 
strengths and potential fields of action in the respective 
organizational units to be considered in order that 
individual optimization opportunities can be derived. 

In addition to these individual activities, Phoenix Contact provides versatile instruments and 
measures within the areas of basic and further training, health management, and work-life balance. 
These are being developed further - or even redeveloped - continually, based on current trends and 
the wishes of the employees. 

Health management
Health management plays an important role at Phoenix 
Contact to such an extent that this subject has 
been reported on several times already in previous 
Communication on Progress reports. 
One service on offer is occupational employee 
counseling, which has become established within 
Phoenix Contact and which has been very well received 
by employees. In addition to counseling on professional 
as well as private issues, colleagues also provide support 
during the entire process of inpatient care in hospitals 
and clinics and after rehabilitation programs. From the 
very beginning, employees benefit from good contact 
to various clinics in order that they can capitalize on 
the service more quickly and avoid long waiting lists for 

PHOENIX CONTACT    13  

places. Employees also receive the support necessary during their stay at a hospital or clinic and 
during the reintegration process from the occupational employee counseling service. 
Health days held annually provide employees with the opportunity to learn about health subjects 
and even to have short health checks. 
The 2015 event was held under the motto ""Movement strengthens the vascular system"". During 
this event, vein measurements, measurements of the diameter of the visceral artery, and blood 
flow measurements were taken, vaccinations were given and information and advice on the 
subject of ""vascular diseases"" was also available.
The 2016 Health Day, under the motto ""Healthy and fit through the summer"", was a complete 
success. Health checks such as osteoporosis measurements, skin screenings, skin analyses and BIA 
measurements were well received by employees. In addition, there were several presentations and 
events on the subject of insurance and immunization protection for overseas travel, and lots of 
useful information helpful for the summer and when on vacation. 
New on offer in 2016 was the first blood donation campaign, which took place on the company 
premises in Blomberg with the DRK-Blutspendedienst West (German Red Cross Blood 
Transfusion Service West) and the DRK-Ortsverein Blomberg (Blomberg branch of the German 
Red Cross). A prior agreement was made with management that this campaign could take place 
during working hours. The response from employees was very good, and the action also attracted 
many first-time donors, who wanted to take on responsibility and also become blood donors. It is 
undoubtedly a campaign that Phoenix Contact will again hold in 2017. 

Basic and further training 
The element of the corporate strategy ""Strategically expanding employee skills"" is very important 
for Phoenix Contact. Basic and further training has a long tradition in the company, because as a 
technologically-oriented company aligned to the future, well trained employees are the foundation 
for achieving the corporate goals. Technologies are developing constantly, in particular in the 
areas of electronics, automation technology and digitization, and knowledge and expertise have 
to be developed and expanded continuously. Networked and integrated thinking will become 
increasingly more important in the future. 
With the launch in 2016 of the Training Center, with 
30 training rooms for ten to 65 participants and IT 
rooms for up to 32 people, the company has created 
exceptional conditions for good basic and further 
training. On the one hand, young professionals are 
trained in eleven training courses and eight dual-
track courses within the Training Center. On the 
other hand, it provides a flexible training program 
for employees that is aligned with the trends and 
the needs of the company. Qualification courses are 
available in the fields of Technology, Business, IT and 
Media, Soft and Leadership Skills, 
and individual solutions are also 
arranged. Approximately 14,000 
participants per year take advantage 
of the qualification courses on offer. 
The Training Center is also an 
event venue for forums, internal 
and external conferences and for 
the regional adult education center. 
It is therefore a location with a 
great learning environment and 
was designed for both internal and 
external networking.

  Social responsibility: Commitment to society 

Phoenix Contact is committed to the sustainable positive development of living and business areas 
and takes its role as a responsible company very seriously. 
Training is an important subject both within the field of internal growth and employee development 
and in social commitment. For example, young people are prepared for their professional life 
through the ""Aubicom project"", and pupils and students gain an insight into professional life through 
excursions or internships. 
Alongside training activities, Phoenix Contact has been championing culture on the site in a variety 
of ways for many years. Regional cultural highlights are sponsored, for example the European Street 
Theater Festival in Detmold, the music and literature festival ""Wege durch das Land"" (journeys 
through the land), and the ""Illumina"" laser show in Bad Pyrmont. 
In cooperation with organizations and institutions, the company would like to actively participate 
in staging modern and eclectic formats in order to strengthen the attractiveness of the region, 
and also to make it accessible to its own employees and interns. Furthermore, the company 
organizes its own seminars and cultural events as non-profit events, for example the annual 
Phoenix Contact Colloquium for the interested general public, which is staged in cooperation 
with the Ostwestfalen-Lippe (OWL) University of Applied Sciences. In 2016, the seminar, on the 
subject ""News in the Age of Social Media - Tradition versus a Brave New World?"", was hosted 
by Pinar Atalay, the presenter of ""Tagesthemen"", the German current affairs TV program.

xplore New Automation 
Award 20th anniversary 
Phoenix Contact has been organizing 
the annual ""xplore New Automation 
Award"" international technology and 
educational competition for 20 years 
and can therefore look back over a 
long tradition. More than 500 projects 
in six categories from over 30 nations 
have been realized. Phoenix Contact 
provides pupil and student groups with 
the technical equipment and personal 
support necessary. The highlight for 
the winners is undoubtedly presenting 
their projects in the categories Smart 

PHOENIX CONTACT    15  

Factory, Environment, Urban Infrastructure, Recreation 
and Infinity at the Hannover Messe, the world's largest 
industry trade fair. 
Phoenix Contact has included the special category 
""Infinity"" for the 20th edition of the competition. With 
the support of partner organizations such as Don Bosco, schools will be selected from so-called 
emerging regions for this. The 300 selected schools will each receive a technology package which 
will enable pupils to get to grips with automation technology and to bring life to their own ideas. 

New Automation Award 

Cooperation with the  
Namibian Institute of Mining and Technology (NIMT) 
The cooperation between Phoenix Contact and the NIMT Institute was initiated in 2014. 
The NIMT Institute is the largest technical vocational training institute in Namibia, with three 
sites. A total of 3000 young people are trained in various technical fields, such as in electrical 
engineering and mechanics.
The aim of this cooperation is on the one hand programs involving employee exchange and 
knowledge sharing, and on the other hand the development of training programs for interns 
in the NIMT Institute and providing support through training materials. These activities are 
aimed at supporting the economical competitiveness of Namibia and at providing employees 
of both organizations with the opportunity of becoming acquainted with and to appreciate the 
respective cultures. 
In previous years, visits lasting several weeks have been made; the director of the Namibian 
institute and some trainers have received an insight into the German education system and 
become acquainted with the didactic structure of projects and learning media. Alongside the 
familiarization process, leisure time should never be neglected. Shareholder Klaus Eisert, several 
employees, interns and dual-track students took the time to show the visitors a little of Germany. 
In the end, all participants were very impressed with the cultural exchange, becoming acquainted 
with a different culture and acknowledged a huge gain in experiences. 
Two dual-track students made 
the return visit in 2016. The two 
students of electrical engineering 
and mechatronic systems spent 
time working in the school and 
developing learning media, but 
also becoming acquainted with the 
country and people of Namibia. 
This cooperation is to be 
continued into the future, and 
further trainers from Namibia and 
students from Germany will be 
given the opportunity of taking 
part in an exchange program.

AIESEC 
Phoenix Contact's membership 
of the national advisory board for 
the student organization AIESEC 
has already been reported on in 
the previous Communication on 
Progress Report. Regular advisory 
board activities and interactions 
strengthen mutual communication. 
Phoenix Contact thus contributes 
to the development of 
responsible and entrepreneurial 
students who can gain practical 
experience in being successful. 
This ensures they are prepared 
for all future challenges. The 
company also supports the regular 
""Youth2Business (Y2B)"" events. 
Phoenix Contact became a partner 
for the first time last year in 
the ""Global Citizen Partnership 

Program"". In this program, students have the opportunity to participate in a social overseas 
project and, thus, to develop their own capabilities and personal expertise through facing new 
challenges, to become acquainted with other cultures, and to gain experience and to strengthen 
social responsibility. Phoenix Contact has supported ten students in overseas projects: for 
example in mentoring and teaching children from difficult backgrounds in Brazil, a project in the 
field of environmental protection in organic farming and in recycling on Mauritius, and in the 
Earth5R project for unemployed women aimed at improving the quality of life in villages in India.
All students have reported on valuable experiences and interesting insights into a new culture, 
and so Phoenix Contact will continue to support this project. In 2017, two Phoenix Contact 
students have the opportunity to take part in this.

charitable trust 
The philosophy of the company 
charitable trust is the sponsorship 
of factually determined and time-
limited projects and research 
programs in the field of natural 
and technological sciences. The 
sponsor Klaus Eisert and the 
board of trustees find it inspiring 
to exchange ideas with young 
scientists during their scientific 
work and to experience progress 
together with them. 
The charitable trust has 
been involved in the field of 
institutional research since 2007 
at the Institute for Industrial 
Information Technology (inIT) of

The corporate mission ""We create progress with innovative and inspiring solutions"" describes the basis of the business – the development of innovative solutions and products. Phoenix Contact would like to meet future megatrends and thus build a ""pioneering bridge to the future"". At the same time, sustainable behavior, preserving resources and protecting the environment are integral parts of the corporate policy for the company. Social responsibility for Phoenix Contact employees is made clear through a value-oriented leadership style and a corporate culture based on partnership and trust, a high level of commitment to training and qualification as well as further internal provisions, for example a comprehensive health management system. The social commitment to society is demonstrated through a multitude of sport and cultural sponsorships and a commitment to education. The Phoenix Contact Corporate Group Executive Board statement.""We feel that we are committed to the positive, sustainable development of places to live and work. Phoenix Contact is aware of its role in society and the environment. As part of our corporate social responsibility and corporate compliance, we take responsibility for adhering to laws, generally applicable values, and principles, and the sustainable management of resources, as well as promoting social commitment, integrity, and professionalism"". Phoenix Contact has been demonstrating this commitment since signing into the United Nations Global Compact in 2005. This voluntary commitment includes upholding ten principles in the fields of human rights, work standards, environmental protection and corruption prevention. Naturally, the company has also been committed to the ""ZVEI Code of Conduct for Corporate Social Responsibility"", the code of the German Electrical Engineering and Electronic Manufacturers' Association, since 2009. The following section highlights selected examples of corporate responsibility activities in the fields of economy, the environment, and social awareness for employees and society:  Economy: Efficient use of resources, thanks to innovative solutions and products Phoenix Contact is passionate about creating innovative solutions and being a part of social megatrends. The company responds to these trends with a broad range of products for various markets; amongst others, with the development of products and solutions in the field of renewable energies in response to the growing shortage of resources. A number of product examples demonstrating this will be highlighted in the following:Intelligent photovoltaic panel shutdown Phoenix Contact has been involved in the field of renewable energies for a long time. Photovoltaic systems have become a significant and established part of energy supply, with an installed power so far of approximately 230 gigawatts worldwide. Roughly two thirds of these systems are installed on building roofs. It must be just as easy and safe to maintain and repair these PV applications as it is to operate them. To this end, thanks to the intelligent SOLARCHECK RSD panel shutdown system, these systems can be automatically disconnected without expert knowledge.According to the latest studies, the feed-in power of PV systems worldwide will increase to approximately 600 gigawatts by 2020. This comparatively small and yet very important portion  of the energy mix contributes to limiting climate change and to the sustainable management of  the available energy reserves. Above all, growth in industrial and municipal applications emphasizes the significance of photovoltaics as a credible element of the energy balance in buildings and operations.This trend is aided by the simplicity of use of these PV applications. As opposed to other energy suppliers, the use of combustible fuel is not necessary, there are no moving parts, and installation and wiring are very easy to realize. Indeed, annual maintenance, the occasional repairs necessary due to damage caused by external influences, and cleaning in order to improve yields are normally the only times that the operator needs to have physical contact with his PV system. Otherwise, the system normally produces electricity reliably and requires no further involvement.The power range of such systems is between 30 and 500 kilowatts. The PV panels in these systems are connected in series and then connected together to the inverter inputs. Through this type of wiring, and depending on the number of panels, the system voltage summates to between several hundred volts up to one kilovolt. DC electricity is present on this side of the PV system; AC electricity for feed-in or other purposes is only present downstream of the inverter.Since all system components have been designed as standard for long-term operation under the influence of weather, the safety of the photovoltaic system is normally also assured. This means that all parts are insulated appropriately and do not therefore represent a danger to people or animals. Nevertheless, each PV application is a real power station. In particular during repairs, operators and technicians must be careful, for example of insulation errors. Physical harm can, however, be fully avoided if the panels on the DC side are disconnected. If this is the case, high voltages cannot be generated and the technician can work in conditions of complete Many PV systems have a central disconnect points at the entrance to the roof or various passive protective measures, such as fireproof cable ducts. None of these activities, however, address the cause of the danger. Activating the disconnection device only interrupts the flow of current; the high voltage remains in the system as long as sunlight falls on the PV system. Even the well-known and, from experience, expedient five safety rules cannot be followed with this DC-side solution because disconnection from voltage sources is not possible. The only proven procedure is the individual disconnection of the PV panels. In this way, high system voltages simply cannot be generated.In terms of equipping the photovoltaic system, this does however mean that each PV panel needs a switching device, which increases the costs accordingly. An argument here in favor of investment costs and against occupational safety is not only inappropriate, but also irresponsible. In order that the attractiveness of PV systems is not reduced, the safety disconnection equipment does however need to be manageable in terms of costs and, above all, be beneficial. To this end, Phoenix Contact has developed an intelligent panel disconnection system that protects everybody involved in the photovoltaic system without them having to have special expert knowledge. The SOLARCHECK RSD system includes two device types which automatically and fully disconnect and then later reconnect the system. Each of the switching units, which are installed directly behind the individual panels, react individually and recognize when the system is behaving abnormally. Such a reaction is judged to be unsafe operation and the panels are then disconnected. Because Solarcheck RSD also recognizes inverter disconnection as being a deviation, the entire system can also be disconnected manually. In the event of cleaning, maintenance or repair, the operator or technician can thus disconnect the entire DC-side of the PV system by disconnecting the inverter. The often discussed subject of first responders is also safely covered, without the necessity  of having specialists on site. One of the first measures here includes disconnecting the building  at the main fuse or even disconnecting an entire block at the main distribution box. Such  steps lead to the standard-compliant disconnection of the DC side of the inverter and thus  The most critical scenario in the event of a fire involving a building with a PV system does not lie in extinguishing the fire, but rather in repairs and the removal of fire-damaged parts. In this case, it must be assumed that cables are damaged or have melted together. Thus, the technician is presented with a situation that is difficult to estimate. If, however, he has disconnected all panels individually via Solarcheck RSD, resulting in the system not being in normal operation, the technician can also work safely in such extreme cases. Reconnection of the photovoltaic system is also fully automatic under controlled conditions. This ensures that the system does not start up again as long as work is being performed on it. The starter unit with intelligent test programs equipped especially for this purpose only allows the energy to flow again when the array is not interrupted and the inverter has been connected and released. This rules out inadvertent With Solarcheck RSD, Phoenix Contact provides a solution that is exclusively for safe disconnection. This system has therefore been designed to be appropriately robust and simple. No additional cabling, configuring or special commissioning is necessary for its installation. The devices are designed for long-term use under harsh conditions and therefore only contain high-quality components. They are not limited to certain inverters or PV panel types. It is thus ensured that the safety function can be installed in all standard crystalline photovoltaic systems, regardless of other components. Load optimization in wind turbine generatorsWind turbine generators are designed for a service life of 20 years. But what happens then? Normally, the systems are dismantled and, wherever possible, sold on. They are then very often relocated to Eastern European countries, where they reliably generate electricity for many more years. This begs the question as to why these systems do not remain on the grid in Germany for Countless operators argue in favor of a longer-term operating life for wind turbine generators (WTGs). This is because the wind turbines are installed at sites that do not allow repowering, or the financial means for a new system are not available to the operator at that point in time. WTGs are not developed for a specific number of years. Rather, their primary components are designed for specific loads. During the development of wind turbine generators, the manufacturers calculate the loads in a way that the wind turbine generators are capable of operating for at least 20 years even in locations that are subject to particularly strong winds. As a consequence, systems - particularly those that are installed inland in less windy locations - often have a relatively high reserve in practice between the load assumption determined during development and the actual value resulting from the operating life. The challenge confronting operators during an application for an operating period extension is proving the structural stability beyond the planned operating period. A surveyor, and in the best case the system manufacturer data regarding the exact design of the WTG, are necessary for such confirmation. Using all of the data available, the surveyor then examines whether the structural stability is assured beyond the approved operating lifetime. Much of the information necessary is very difficult to determine and can only be calculated via interpolation. Thus, the surveyors often have to refer to wind field analyses and wind data from the system control, for example, in order to be able to estimate the load on the components during their lifetime so far. This data is, in most cases, inaccurate or incomplete and must therefore be overlaid with an appropriate risk factor. For the exact determination of a possible operating period extension, it is therefore advantageous if the exact load data recorded over as long a time period as possible is available. Ideally, a wind turbine generator that is intended for further use should be equipped with a load measurement system from the point of commissioning. If this is not the case, the immediate retrofitting of such a load measurement system is expedient. This enables as much reliable data to be collected as possible, based on which the surveyor can create a significantly more exact forecast as to how long the wind turbine generator may remain on the grid. In order to utilize the absolute load limit of the wind turbine generator, the operator should still have the load measurement system installed even if the extension to the operating period has already been granted. In this way, it is possible to determine precisely the extent to which the loads assumed for the extended service life have been exceeded or not reached. The operator can now decide whether to decommission his system early or to further prolong the extended operating period.It is now the case that as a part of some approvals for extended operation, continuous monitoring of the loads is demanded explicitly. Currently, there are very few systems available on the market with which the loads of a wind turbine generator can be reliably measured. The Phoenix Contact Rotor Blade Tension Monitoring System (RBTM) is one of the first solutions in this field.The RBTM system can be fully integrated into new wind turbine generators and retrofitted into existing WTGs. These products are very quick to install and replace, and the expenditure for this is relatively low. With this solution, the loads arising in the blade root are recorded, preprocessed, and transmitted to a superordinate system, and defined actions are taken autonomously. Alongside the general vibration analysis, the RBTM enables the determination of load spectrums, which simplify the estimation of the remaining service life. If the data regarding the loads on the rotor blades in a WTG is recorded, the process of approval for further operation is simplified significantly. The load measurements can furthermore be used to optimize the operation of the wind turbine generator and to ensure the longest possible period of further operation. Older systems whose locations are not suitable for repowering can be utilized for the maximum service life of the components in this way.Growth of E-Mobility in the NetherlandsE-Mobility will only become accepted once the vehicle can be charged rapidly anywhere. Along with Phoenix Contact and ABB, Fastned is contributing to this vision slowly but surely becoming a reality in the Netherlands. ""In the foreseeable future, you will be able to cover a distance of 400 kilometers with an electric car on just one charge. This does away with the need for charging in your home garage. Rather, vehicles will be recharged at work or on the motorway"", says Crijn Bouman, Vice President of Business Development at ABB Electrical Vehicle & Charging Infrastructure. Today, the Swiss concern is one of the leading providers of Internet-based charging infrastructure. The charging stations have a cloud link based on open standards, enabling them to be connected to all service and payment applications. Furthermore, they are equipped with all relevant rapid charging plugs, enabling all E-vehicles to be charged. The business relationship between today's ABB Electrical Vehicle division and Phoenix Contact stretches back to 2010. ""Back then, we took up a pioneering role in E-Mobility together with Phoenix Contact"", remembers Bouman. ""Both companies were represented within the commission that defined the European rapid charging standard CSS (Combined Charging System). The foundation was laid during this period for intensive cooperation, within the framework of which, for example, we had a two-way exchange on the subject of ergonomics. The first few years were taken up with the development of prototypes. Currently, the E-Mobility sector is growing continuously. Among other things, a new generation of charging plugs is currently being designed which will enable even more power to be conducted"". A good example of how dynamically the market is expanding is, according to Bouman, the growth of the rapid charging network in the Netherlands. The stock market-listed Fastned company is commissioning new charging stations every week, for example. Established in 2011, Fastned received the concession in 2012 for building rapid charging units at 201 freeway service stations. Approximately 130 stations are due to be in operation by the end of 2017. This is necessary because the Dutch government has resolved that by 2020, 2.5 percent and by 2025, 12.5 percent of the approximately eight million licensed cars are to be electrically powered. And because the motorists do not want to relinquish the familiar convenience of conventional vehicles, the E-vehicle batteries need to be able to be recharged in a very short period of time.Set to this background, in the summer of 2013 Fastned awarded ABB with the contract for providing suitable charging stations, with which the electric vehicles can be charged within 15 to 20 minutes this, ABB uses Phoenix Contact CCS (Combined Charging System) charging plugs. Furthermore, the stations include type 2 AC plugs in accordance with IEC 62196 for conventional charging with AC power and CHAdeMO plugs (Charge for Moving). The Combined Charging System (CCS) was developed by the German and American automotive industries in cooperation with Phoenix Contact. The aim was to standardize the charging interface between the vehicle and the charging station. At the same time, both the established AC charging and the much faster DC charging was to be possible. The result is the now-widespread ""type 2 combined interface"" with just one plug-in contact on the E-vehicle, via which it can be charged at both AC and DC stations. Thus, users can either charge their electric vehicles with alternating current conventionally over night in their garage, or on longer stopovers in car parks. Furthermore, rapid charging in just a few minutes at service stations, restaurants, supermarkets and banks is also possible. Naturally, safety measures are also built in; on the one hand, an electromechanical interlock actuator, and, on the other hand, monitoring of the charging current in the event of the system overheating. The Fastned charging stations are easily recognizable thanks to their design. The prominent roof does not just offer protection in the event of bad weather, but is also equipped with solar panels. Indeed, the energy provided by Fastned for charging electric vehicles is generated entirely by wind and solar power. Battery storage systems at the individual stations buffer the energy generated for those times when the sun is not sufficient or there is little wind. There are at least two rapid charging points per station in order to minimize longer queuing times. Furthermore, customers have access to a Wi-Fi network. Thus, for example, they can read their e-mails, prepare meetings, listen to music or even watch TV while their vehicle is charging. Fastned is certain that the faster charging speed will also reduce the cost of charging. If hundreds of E-vehicles can be charged per day, the higher financial expenditure for the hardware laid out by the company will be recovered In order that this technological position is maintained, ABB continues to work closely together with Phoenix Contact. Higher charging currents are in the planning phase that will enable the action radius, currently at 150 kilometers, to be extended to 300 to 500 kilometers once the battery performance improves. The value for rapid charging on the road amounts to a minimum of 100 to 350 kilowatts. Against this background, the heat balance of charging stations and connectors is of crucial importance. In this regard, Bouman asserts: ""There are only a few companies that are able to supply such a charging plug. Therefore, Phoenix Contact opens up a high level of added value to us in this environment"".  Environment: Conservation of resources at Phoenix ContactPhoenix Contact has focused on activities for increasing efficiency, environmentally responsible production and using environmentally friendly and sustainable building technology for many years:""Environmental protection is an integral part of our corporate policy. A main focus of our activities is on taking responsibility for the sustained protection of our resources"".The energy management system in accordance with DIN EN ISO 50001 ensures the necessary transparency and measurability of the steps implemented. The successful recertification in 2016 accredited the measures implemented and highlighted further potentials for optimization. Energy efficiency trainingA new course on offer is the training program ""Energy efficiency compact: possibilities for reducing the energy requirement"", aimed at those responsible for energy, employees who have an interest in the subjects of energy and energy efficiency, and those who are involved with energy during their activities within the company. Upon completion of the training program, the participants should be in a position to demonstrate methods for increasing energy efficiency within the company. They can develop their own ideas and measures aimed at reducing the energy requirements of the com-pany. Furthermore, participants can identify the energy saving measures that Phoenix Contact has previously introduced and become acquainted with the contact persons in order to receive sup-port on the subjects of energy and energy efficiency.Construction of new office buildingNew energy efficient technologies and renewable energies are being installed at the Phoenix Contact sites wherever possible in order to ensure the optimum utilization and conservation of resources. In the construction of a new Phoenix Contact Electronics building, the technical highlight is the building automation. Many installations are barely visible to the employees or even not noticeable, and yet energy data, the lighting or occupancy of meeting rooms and corners can be displayed via a page on the intranet. Employees can see whether the ceiling mounted cooling systems are running, the value they are set to and whether there is a malfunction. In such cases, a message is sent via telephone to employees in Facility Management, who can immediately see what the malfunction is. Thus, any consequential damage is avoided. Energy data on the individ-ual rooms, rotation speeds and consumption are displayed transparently and with progression curves in order that in the event of increasing energy consumption with no apparent explanation, the cause can be ascertained more quickly. Furthermore, a system has been installed which, in the event of a fire, blocks the ways to the location of the fire and guides employees out of the  building via the correct path. The entire roof area of the new building has been equipped with a photovoltaic system that includes 670 panels covering an area of 935 square meters. In the system can generate a power of 175,000 kilowatt hours per year, which is comparable with the average amount of energy consumed by 46 single family homes each with three people. The energy generated is exclu-sively for in-house consumption. A storage system has also been installed so that a small amount of energy can be stored interme-diately. The photovoltaic system also serves as a test system for products developed by Phoenix Contact. Among other products, Sunclix connectors, the Solarcheck system for efficiency monitoring and the intelligent disconnection of photovoltaic panels with Auto Rapid Shutdown (RSD) have been installed. The Solarcheck RSD sys-tem and its scope of application are described in detail in the Econ-omy section. The building is a perfect example of the possibilities of modern building technology. An intel-ligent connection between the energy supply, heating and cooling circuits and the production areas enables the sustainable, energy efficient operation of the site. Due to the supply process, the building does not need heating and cooling systems. Interested customers can see and experience first hand how and where they can install Phoenix Contact products and what they While designing the architecture of the building, great value was also placed on the possibilities for communication. There are the usual meeting rooms, closed off seating areas and shortcuts to the coffee rooms. The so-called plaza is also an ideal meeting point.   Social responsibility: Commitment to our employeesPhoenix Contact attaches great importance to an appreciative and trustworthy corporate culture as well as to the development of employees. This is also specified in the corporate culture: ""Our corporate culture promotes trust and employee development to achieve our agreed objectives"". The expectation of a mutually respectful appreciative environment is also reflected in management's mission statement, including aspects such as ""trust"", ""respect and appreciation"" and ""promotion and development"".The depth of the culture of the trust within the Phoenix Contact Group is measured every two years via the employee survey in association with the Great Place to Work Institute. Reports on individual results enable the strengths and potential fields of action in the respective organizational units to be considered in order that individual optimization opportunities can be derived. In addition to these individual activities, Phoenix Contact provides versatile instruments and measures within the areas of basic and further training, health management, and work-life balance. These are being developed further - or even redeveloped - continually, based on current trends and the wishes of the employees. Health management plays an important role at Phoenix Contact to such an extent that this subject has been reported on several times already in previous Communication on Progress reports. One service on offer is occupational employee counseling, which has become established within Phoenix Contact and which has been very well received by employees. In addition to counseling on professional as well as private issues, colleagues also provide support during the entire process of inpatient care in hospitals and clinics and after rehabilitation programs. From the very beginning, employees benefit from good contact to various clinics in order that they can capitalize on the service more quickly and avoid long waiting lists for places. Employees also receive the support necessary during their stay at a hospital or clinic and during the reintegration process from the occupational employee counseling service. Health days held annually provide employees with the opportunity to learn about health subjects and even to have short health checks. The 2015 event was held under the motto ""Movement strengthens the vascular system"". During this event, vein measurements, measurements of the diameter of the visceral artery, and blood flow measurements were taken, vaccinations were given and information and advice on the subject of ""vascular diseases"" was also available.The 2016 Health Day, under the motto ""Healthy and fit through the summer"", was a complete success. Health checks such as osteoporosis measurements, skin screenings, skin analyses and BIA measurements were well received by employees. In addition, there were several presentations and events on the subject of insurance and immunization protection for overseas travel, and lots of useful information helpful for the summer and when on vacation. New on offer in 2016 was the first blood donation campaign, which took place on the company premises in Blomberg with the DRK-Blutspendedienst West (German Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service West) and the DRK-Ortsverein Blomberg (Blomberg branch of the German Red Cross). A prior agreement was made with management that this campaign could take place during working hours. The response from employees was very good, and the action also attracted many first-time donors, who wanted to take on responsibility and also become blood donors. It is undoubtedly a campaign that Phoenix Contact will again hold in 2017. Basic and further training The element of the corporate strategy ""Strategically expanding employee skills"" is very important for Phoenix Contact. Basic and further training has a long tradition in the company, because as a technologically-oriented company aligned to the future, well trained employees are the foundation for achieving the corporate goals. Technologies are developing constantly, in particular in the areas of electronics, automation technology and digitization, and knowledge and expertise have to be developed and expanded continuously. Networked and integrated thinking will become increasingly more important in the future. With the launch in 2016 of the Training Center, with 30 training rooms for ten to 65 participants and IT rooms for up to 32 people, the company has created exceptional conditions for good basic and further training. On the one hand, young professionals are trained in eleven training courses and eight dual-track courses within the Training Center. On the other hand, it provides a flexible training program for employees that is aligned with the trends and the needs of the company. Qualification courses are available in the fields of Technology, Business, IT and Media, Soft and Leadership Skills, and individual solutions are also arranged. Approximately 14,000 participants per year take advantage of the qualification courses on offer. The Training Center is also an and external conferences and for the regional adult education center. It is therefore a location with a great learning environment and was designed for both internal and external networking.   Social responsibility: Commitment to society Phoenix Contact is committed to the sustainable positive development of living and business areas and takes its role as a responsible company very seriously. Training is an important subject both within the field of internal growth and employee development and in social commitment. For example, young people are prepared for their professional life through the ""Aubicom project"", and pupils and students gain an insight into professional life through excursions or internships. Alongside training activities, Phoenix Contact has been championing culture on the site in a variety of ways for many years. Regional cultural highlights are sponsored, for example the European Street Theater Festival in Detmold, the music and literature festival ""Wege durch das Land"" (journeys through the land), and the ""Illumina"" laser show in Bad Pyrmont. In cooperation with organizations and institutions, the company would like to actively participate in staging modern and eclectic formats in order to strengthen the attractiveness of the region, and also to make it accessible to its own employees and interns. Furthermore, the company organizes its own seminars and cultural events as non-profit events, for example the annual Phoenix Contact Colloquium for the interested general public, which is staged in cooperation with the Ostwestfalen-Lippe (OWL) University of Applied Sciences. In 2016, the seminar, on the subject ""News in the Age of Social Media - Tradition versus a Brave New World?"", was hosted by Pinar Atalay, the presenter of ""Tagesthemen"", the German current affairs TV program.xplore New Automation Award 20th anniversary Phoenix Contact has been organizing the annual ""xplore New Automation Award"" international technology and educational competition for 20 years and can therefore look back over a long tradition. More than 500 projects in six categories from over 30 nations have been realized. Phoenix Contact provides pupil and student groups with the technical equipment and personal support necessary. The highlight for the winners is undoubtedly presenting their projects in the categories Smart Factory, Environment, Urban Infrastructure, Recreation and Infinity at the Hannover Messe, the world's largest industry trade fair. Phoenix Contact has included the special category ""Infinity"" for the 20th edition of the competition. With the support of partner organizations such as Don Bosco, schools will be selected from so-called emerging regions for this. The 300 selected schools will each receive a technology package which will enable pupils to get to grips with automation technology and to bring life to their own ideas. New Automation Award Cooperation with the  Namibian Institute of Mining and Technology (NIMT) The cooperation between Phoenix Contact and the NIMT Institute was initiated in 2014. The NIMT Institute is the largest technical vocational training institute in Namibia, with three sites. A total of 3000 young people are trained in various technical fields, such as in electrical engineering and mechanics.The aim of this cooperation is on the one hand programs involving employee exchange and knowledge sharing, and on the other hand the development of training programs for interns in the NIMT Institute and providing support through training materials. These activities are aimed at supporting the economical competitiveness of Namibia and at providing employees of both organizations with the opportunity of becoming acquainted with and to appreciate the In previous years, visits lasting several weeks have been made; the director of the Namibian institute and some trainers have received an insight into the German education system and become acquainted with the didactic structure of projects and learning media. Alongside the familiarization process, leisure time should never be neglected. Shareholder Klaus Eisert, several employees, interns and dual-track students took the time to show the visitors a little of Germany. In the end, all participants were very impressed with the cultural exchange, becoming acquainted with a different culture and acknowledged a huge gain in experiences. Two dual-track students made the return visit in 2016. The two students of electrical engineering and mechatronic systems spent time working in the school and developing learning media, but also becoming acquainted with the country and people of Namibia. This cooperation is to be continued into the future, and further trainers from Namibia and students from Germany will be given the opportunity of taking part in an exchange program.Phoenix Contact's membership of the national advisory board for the student organization AIESEC has already been reported on in the previous Communication on Progress Report. Regular advisory board activities and interactions strengthen mutual communication. Phoenix Contact thus contributes to the development of students who can gain practical experience in being successful. This ensures they are prepared for all future challenges. The company also supports the regular ""Youth2Business (Y2B)"" events. Phoenix Contact became a partner for the first time last year in the ""Global Citizen Partnership Program"". In this program, students have the opportunity to participate in a social overseas project and, thus, to develop their own capabilities and personal expertise through facing new challenges, to become acquainted with other cultures, and to gain experience and to strengthen social responsibility. Phoenix Contact has supported ten students in overseas projects: for example in mentoring and teaching children from difficult backgrounds in Brazil, a project in the field of environmental protection in organic farming and in recycling on Mauritius, and in the Earth5R project for unemployed women aimed at improving the quality of life in villages in India.All students have reported on valuable experiences and interesting insights into a new culture, and so Phoenix Contact will continue to support this project. In 2017, two Phoenix Contact students have the opportunity to take part in this. Phoenix Contact The philosophy of the company charitable trust is the sponsorship of factually determined and time-limited projects and research programs in the field of natural and technological sciences. The sponsor Klaus Eisert and the board of trustees find it inspiring to exchange ideas with young scientists during their scientific work and to experience progress together with them. The charitable trust has been involved in the field of institutional research since 2007 at the Institute for Industrial Information Technology (inIT) of the Ostwestfalen-Lippe University of Applied Sciences. Without the trust, the inIT would not have been in a position to develop so quickly into a leading research institute, to realize the first German Science-to-Business Center CIIT in the field of intelligent automation, to establish the research factory SmartFactoryOWL together research organization or to establish the Fraunhofer Institute and company.

Making Progress on Corporate Responsibility Measures  

We  believe  that  sustainable  and  socially  responsible  business  practice  makes  smart  business  and 
underscores our commitment to the environment, our employees, and the communities where we 
work.  This  year,  our  sustainable  journey  continued  to  take  concrete  actions  towards  the  ten 
principles set by the  UN Global Compact  (UNGC)  under Human Rights,  Labour, Environmental and 
Anti-Corruption. Our support to the UNGC resulted in us being elected for the Steering Committee 
Members in the United Arab Emirates and we are now co-chairs of the UN Women’s Empowerment 
Principles  and  Business  for  Peace  Taskforce.  We  hope  by  leading  by  example  we  can  inspire 
companies  in  the  region,  as  well  as,  within  the  manufacturing  sector  to  incorporate  the  UNGC 
principles  into  their  operations.  This  Communication  on  Progress  discusses  who  we  are,  our  work 
towards  the  10  Principles  and  a  more  sustainable  business,  as  well  as,  our  commitments  to  the 
United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  and  towards  the  World  Humanitarian 
Summit.  

 

I.  Who we Are 

NRS  International is  a  family-run  company  that  manufactures  and  develops  products  for the 
humanitarian,  public  health  and  development  sectors.  Responding  to  the  growing  demands  of 
vulnerable populations, we aim to improve the lives of people in need by providing innovative, high 
quality and cost-effective aid essentials. Our products are fully compliant with the highest industry 
standards. Headquartered in Dubai, UAE, we are the parent company to four subsidiaries: 

  NRS  Relief offers core  relief  items, family  tents, multi-purpose  shelters and mobile  storage 
units to the humanitarian sector. Through its innovative products that adhere to the highest 
international  standards,  aid  organisations  can  effectively  alleviate  the  suffering  of  people 
experiencing disasters and conflicts. 

  TANA Netting manufactures high quality, WHOPES-recommended DawaPlus® 2.0 insecticide 

treated nets as a tool for malaria control and prevention. 

  Enlight develops  and  manufactures  solar  solutions  for  the  developing  world. From  entry-
level  lights  through  to  mini-grids,  its  products  bring  power,  light  and  connectivity  to 
households,  communities  and  businesses  struggling  to  thrive  with  unreliable  electricity 
supply.  

  Ulinzi  Latex manufactures  high  quality,  totally  reliable  and  affordable reproductive  health 
products for  the  institutional  market.  By  2022,  it  aims  to  become  the  largest  condom 

Page 1 of 12 

manufacturer  worldwide  by  volume.  This  will  increase  access  to  family  planning  and  will 
bring new impetus in the fight against HIV/AIDS. 

 

 

II.  We manufacture what we sell 

We  fully  control  our  supply  chain  and  manage  the  entire  product  development  process  from 
manufacturing through to final delivery. Our core relief items, public health and solar products are 
manufactured  exclusively  by H.  Sheikh  Noor-ud-Din  &  Sons (HSNDS)  in  Pakistan,  our  factory  that 
employs  over  7,400  skilled  workers.  After  leaving  the  factory,  our  expert  logisticians  facilitate  the 
transportation of our products by air, sea and land to wherever they are required, and also maintain 
strategic stocks in Dubai and Lahore. View our integrated catalogue 

 

 

 

III.  We never stand still 

Our  approach  is  to  lead  and  innovate.  We  invest  in  research  and  development  to  continuously 
improve the products we make and how we make them. By working hand-in-hand with our clients, 
suppliers  and  beneficiaries  we  are  able  to  design  new  solutions,  improve  existing  products  and 
ensure that our products meet international quality standards. Our clients and their beneficiaries are 
at the centre of everything we do. This year, we introduced two new products in collaboration with 
our partners Oxfam and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). In 
2014 we were the first supplier to offer affordable and fully fire retardant tents and tarpaulins to the 
humanitarian community, a truly life-saving innovation which won the Aid Innovation Challenge  at 
AidEx 2014.  

 

IV. 

Partnering for Sustainable Solutions  

Now  more  than  ever,  we  know  that  we  cannot  work  in  isolation.  SDG  17  recognizes  that  the 
ambitious  SDGs  cannot  be  attached  unless  governments,  civil  society,  the  private  and  the  UN 
systems and other stakeholders work  together. This past  year, we continued to create meaningful 
partnerships  through  various  industry  platforms  to  leverage  expertise,  pool  resources,  and  share 
best-practices.  Through  this  collaborative  approach  we  are  creating  systematic  change  to  the  aid, 
relief and development sectors. Partners and membership organizations, include;

V. 

Commitment to Lean Manufacturing  

We  have  been  consistent  advocates  and  practitioners  of  responsible  production.  Our  businesses 
strive for environmental, social and financial sustainability through the rigorous control of product 
development processes and supply chains, from manufacturing to delivery. Robust quality assurance 
ensures compliance with environmental and social accountability certifications, such as ISO 14000, 
ISO 9001 and SA 8000. Our sustainability culture ensures that we always look for ways to improve 
production standards. The decision of senior management in 2016 to implement  a comprehensive 
Lean production regime marks our latest step in this journey. Watch a short video here.  

Battling the 3Ms with the 5S 

Drawn  from  Japanese  production  methods  pioneered  by  Toyota,  lean  production  maximizes 
consumer value while minimizing waste in all forms. Collectively, these forms are known as the 3Ms: 

  Muda: any activity/process that does not add value e.g. defects and overproduction 

  Mura: unevenness, e.g. a stop-start workflow caused by a lack of harmony 

  Muri: overburden on employees and processes caused by e.g. lack of training 

 

We  seek  to  eliminate  the  3Ms  through kaizen –  an  ethos  of  continuous  improvement  –  and  five 
systematic steps known as 5S: 

Sort (Seiri): identifying waste, including the red tag activity 

Set-in-order (Seiton): tidying, throwing waste, redesigning processes 

Shine (Seiso): daily cleaning, optimisation of set-in-order changes 

Standardize (Seiketsu): creating standards for all processes, maintain order. 

Sustain (Shitsuke): sustaining all of the above.

To implement this agenda, a week of training was conducted in September 2016 in consultation with 
Spring Vision Group, an expert in green production. Broken into thematic modules, this programme 
introduced  senior  management  across  all  production  units  to  lean  management  concepts  and 
techniques. Before the training, a lean policy was adopted by NRS International and HSNDS directors 
and diffused throughout all subsidiaries. To aid the application of 5S principles, NRS International’s 
structure has been reimagined along lean lines, including: 

  The appointment of a Lean Coordinator 

  The formation of a Steering, Audit and Advisory Committees 

  The division of production facilities into distinct zones 

  The assignment of Lean team leaders, facilitators and trainers to all zones.  

As  of  January  2017,  all  zones  have  started  implementation  of  Lean  5S,  beginning  with  sorting 
activities. To this end, a ‘red tag ceremony’ was held in December 2016, whereby waste in all forms 
was clearly demarcated with a label bearing a deadline for elimination. Moving forward, we aim to 
move  through  5S  systematically  over  the  coming  months,  beginning  with  a  progression  to  set-in-
order  across  departments.  However,  because  our  subsidiaries  face  different  operational 
environments  and  challenges,  production  facilities  and  zones  will  not  move  at  a  uniform  pace. 
Rather, they will be allowed the space to move at their own speed to ensure the most sustainable 
outcomes. Progress will be tracked using Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) metrics and incorporated 
into our Annual Report released in 2017.   

 

VI.  Our work towards the 10 Principles 

We  take  our  work  towards  the  10  principles  very  seriously.  We  have  outlined  our  policy, 
implementation  strategies,  and  actions  to  achieve  a  more  sustainability  company.  In  the  coming 
year, we will continue to deepen our commitment and work towards these important goals.

","United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress  From February 2016 to February 2017  Making Progress on Corporate Responsibility Measures  We  believe  that  sustainable  and  socially  responsible  business  practice  makes  smart  business  and underscores our commitment to the environment, our employees, and the communities where we work.  This  year,  our  sustainable  journey  continued  to  take  concrete  actions  towards  the  ten principles set by the  UN Global Compact  (UNGC)  under Human Rights,  Labour, Environmental and Anti-Corruption.

From  entry-level  lights  through  to  mini-grids,  its  products  bring  power,  light  and  connectivity  to households,  communities  and  businesses  struggling  to  thrive  with  unreliable  electricity supply.    Ulinzi  Latex manufactures  high  quality,  totally  reliable  and  affordable reproductive  health products for  the  institutional  market.  By  2022,  it  aims  to  become  the  largest  condom Page 1 of 12 manufacturer  worldwide  by  volume.  This  will  increase  access  to  family  planning  and  will bring new impetus in the fight against HIV/AIDS.   II.  We manufacture what we sell We  fully  control  our  supply  chain  and  manage  the  entire  product  development  process  from manufacturing through to final delivery. Our core relief items, public health and solar products are manufactured  exclusively  by H.  Sheikh  Noor-ud-Din  &  Sons (HSNDS)  in  Pakistan,  our  factory  that employs  over  7,400  skilled  workers.  After  leaving  the  factory,  our  expert  logisticians  facilitate  the transportation of our products by air, sea and land to wherever they are required, and also maintain strategic stocks in Dubai and Lahore. View our integrated catalogue    Our  approach  is  to  lead  and  innovate.  We  invest  in  research  and  development  to  continuously improve the products we make and how we make them. By working hand-in-hand with our clients, suppliers  and  beneficiaries  we  are  able  to  design  new  solutions,  improve  existing  products  and ensure that our products meet international quality standards. Our clients and their beneficiaries are at the centre of everything we do. This year, we introduced two new products in collaboration with our partners Oxfam and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). In 2014 we were the first supplier to offer affordable and fully fire retardant tents and tarpaulins to the humanitarian community, a truly life-saving innovation which won the Aid Innovation Challenge  at  Partnering for Sustainable Solutions  Now  more  than  ever,  we  know  that  we  cannot  work  in  isolation.  SDG  17  recognizes  that  the ambitious  SDGs  cannot  be  attached  unless  governments,  civil  society,  the  private  and  the  UN systems and other stakeholders work  together. This past  year, we continued to create meaningful partnerships  through  various  industry  platforms  to  leverage  expertise,  pool  resources,  and  share best-practices.  Through  this  collaborative  approach  we  are  creating  systematic  change  to  the  aid, relief and development sectors. Partners and membership organizations, include;  Page 2 of 12   Global Business Coalition for Heath   Global Business Coalition Education    UN Women’s Empowerment Principles   Business for Peace    Global Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA)   Nothing But Nets    Energy Access Practitioner Network   Commitment to Lean Manufacturing  We  have  been  consistent  advocates  and  practitioners  of  responsible  production.  Our  businesses strive for environmental, social and financial sustainability through the rigorous control of product development processes and supply chains, from manufacturing to delivery. Robust quality assurance ensures compliance with environmental and social accountability certifications, such as ISO 14000, ISO 9001 and SA 8000. Our sustainability culture ensures that we always look for ways to improve production standards. The decision of senior management in 2016 to implement  a comprehensive Lean production regime marks our latest step in this journey. Watch a short video here.  Battling the 3Ms with the 5S Drawn  from  Japanese  production  methods  pioneered  by  Toyota,  lean  production  maximizes consumer value while minimizing waste in all forms. Collectively, these forms are known as the 3Ms:   Muda: any activity/process that does not add value e.g. defects and overproduction   Mura: unevenness, e.g. a stop-start workflow caused by a lack of harmony   Muri: overburden on employees and processes caused by e.g. lack of training  We  seek  to  eliminate  the  3Ms  through kaizen –  an  ethos  of  continuous  improvement  –  and  five systematic steps known as 5S: Sort (Seiri): identifying waste, including the red tag activity Set-in-order (Seiton): tidying, throwing waste, redesigning processes Shine (Seiso): daily cleaning, optimisation of set-in-order changes Standardize (Seiketsu): creating standards for all processes, maintain order. Sustain (Shitsuke): sustaining all of the above.          Page 3 of 12  To implement this agenda, a week of training was conducted in September 2016 in consultation with Spring Vision Group, an expert in green production. Broken into thematic modules, this programme introduced  senior  management  across  all  production  units  to  lean  management  concepts  and techniques. Before the training, a lean policy was adopted by NRS International and HSNDS directors and diffused throughout all subsidiaries. To aid the application of 5S principles, NRS International’s structure has been reimagined along lean lines, including:   The appointment of a Lean Coordinator   The formation of a Steering, Audit and Advisory Committees   The division of production facilities into distinct zones   The assignment of Lean team leaders, facilitators and trainers to all zones.  As  of  January  2017,  all  zones  have  started  implementation  of  Lean  5S,  beginning  with  sorting activities. To this end, a ‘red tag ceremony’ was held in December 2016, whereby waste in all forms was clearly demarcated with a label bearing a deadline for elimination. Moving forward, we aim to move  through  5S  systematically  over  the  coming  months,  beginning  with  a  progression  to  set-in-order  across  departments.  However,  because  our  subsidiaries  face  different  operational environments  and  challenges,  production  facilities  and  zones  will  not  move  at  a  uniform  pace. Rather, they will be allowed the space to move at their own speed to ensure the most sustainable outcomes. Progress will be tracked using Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) metrics and incorporated into our Annual Report released in 2017.    VI.  Our work towards the 10 Principles We  take  our  work  towards  the  10  principles  very  seriously.  We  have  outlined  our  policy, implementation  strategies,  and  actions  to  achieve  a  more  sustainability  company.

5. Human Rights principles

Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection 
of internationally proclaimed human rights; and

Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights 
abuses

AQ Group AB

5. a) Assessment, Policy & Goals

AQ Group’s goal is for all our employees and business partners to live up to the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The goal is to have 0 reported human rights 
cases. 

Our Core Values and code of conduct outlines the way each of us should behave and 
also clarifies our responsibility to report instances of human rights violations. 

The code of conduct is known to all employees within the company. Also our immediate 
supply chain should adhere to the same principles. The principles are clearly stated in 
the AQ Supplier Code of Conduct. 

AQ Group AB

5. b) Implementation

All employees and external stakeholders can report violations directly by sending a 
message to whistleblower@aqg.se should there be any grievances with regards to 
human rights. However, in most cases contacting the local management team and 
or group management should be enough.  

This year the AQ Group continually implemented its core values, which was 
established in early 2012, across all AQ companies. One of the cornerstones of the 
core values is “Courage and Respect” including the principles, “Every employee has 
the same status” and “We treat others as we like to be treated ourselves”. A copy of 
the AQ “Core Values” booklet has been handed to each employee in local language 
and workshops have taken place to further strengthen their understanding across 
the company. This together with the AQ Code of Conduct and the global policies on 
human rights gives guidance how to act within the AQ Group in any given situation.

Suppliers are audited using the standard AQ Group template which contains a 
section on human rights and they are required to adhere to the AQ Group supplier 
code of conduct. Suppliers who have questionable ethics are not approved as an 
AQ supplier.
AQ Group AB

5. c) Measurement of Outcomes

In AQ Group there have been no reported incidents of human rights abuses. If any 
issues should occur in the future they will be recorded and brought to the attention 
of group management and the related authorities. AQ Group is fully committed to 
handle any such occurrences objectively and to provide fair solutions.

In the last three years we have had 0 human rights violation reports.

equipment is used by our employees. During workshop audits the work environment 
is constantly reviewed for any new or potential safety risks and appropriate actions 
are taken if any such cases arise.

6. c) Measurements of Outcomes

female employees represent 45% of the headcount. 
AQ have since 2015 implemented a company self assessment that is done by the 
management of every subsidiary within the group. This gives the group 
management a good understanding of the labor rights status in the group as a 
whole. The results from this survey in 2016 show high scores on average. A gap 
analysis is also made in order to strengthen the subsidiaries where the score is low. 
The score in 2016 was on average 2,86 where 3 is highest. No subsidiary within the 
group have scored lower than 2. Our target is to have an average score higher than 
2.5 and that no subsidiary should have score lower than 2. 
AQ Group’s subsidiaries are continuously being audited by its customers. During 
2016 we have passed audits from but not limited to, Volvo, Scania, Siemens, Bosch, 
Alstom, GE, Ericsson, Bombardier, ABB and Tetra Pak. These companies focus 
strongly on Corporate Social Responsibility and check for our compliance in these 
areas. Many of these companies can be found in the ”Advanced” group of
companies that adhere to the UN Global Compact principles.

8. Anti-Corruption Principles

Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its 
forms, including extortion and bribery

AQ Group AB

8. a) Assessment, Policy & Goals

AQ Group puts great emphasis on building trust and long lasting
relations with our employees, customers and suppliers. It lies in our
business ethics to always follow laws and regulations as a minimum requirement in 
all countries we operate.
We do not, under any circumstances, accept bribery, extortion or
any other kind of corrupt activities. It is stated in our code of
conduct that we shall always conduct good business ethics and that we do not offer 
rewards or benefits, which are in conflict with laws or regulations, to customers, 
suppliers or authority representatives.

Every employee that are involved in business transactions receive training on our 
code of conduct and our supplier code of conduct which clearly indicates our stance 
on corruption:
“If an employee is offered a gift, a bribe, an illegitimate commission, 
or any other form personal payment, it must not be accepted.” Also, a preliminary 
evaluation of the risk of corruption was made. The biggest risks come in the form of 
supplier/customer gifts and bribes.

8. c) Results

Regarding the aforementioned examples of corruption: We make it clear to our 
employees and supply chain partners that we will not accept behavior of this kind. If

Audits from senior management take place at various intervals to check that 
standard procedures are being followed. And to cement these principles the 
management of each subsidiary need to commit to our principles in our yearly self 
assessment.

In 2016 the whistleblower@aqg.se email and policy have also been implemented in 
order to make it safe to report violations for internal and external stakeholders.

The goal is to have 0 reported human rights Our Core Values and code of conduct outlines the way each of us should behave and also clarifies our responsibility to report instances of human rights violations.

The principles are clearly stated in the AQ Supplier Code of Conduct. AQ Group ABAll employees and external stakeholders can report violations directly by sending a message to whistleblower@aqg.se should there be any grievances with regards to human rights. However, in most cases contacting the local management team and or group management should be enough.  This year the AQ Group continually implemented its core values, which was established in early 2012, across all AQ companies. One of the cornerstones of the core values is “Courage and Respect” including the principles, “Every employee has the same status” and “We treat others as we like to be treated ourselves”. A copy of the AQ “Core Values” booklet has been handed to each employee in local language and workshops have taken place to further strengthen their understanding across the company. This together with the AQ Code of Conduct and the global policies on human rights gives guidance how to act within the AQ Group in any given situation.Suppliers are audited using the standard AQ Group template which contains a section on human rights and they are required to adhere to the AQ Group supplier code of conduct. Suppliers who have questionable ethics are not approved as an AQ Group AB5. c) Measurement of OutcomesIn AQ Group there have been no reported incidents of human rights abuses.

AQ have since 2015 implemented a company self assessment that is done by the management of every subsidiary within the group. This gives the group management a good understanding of the labor rights status in the group as a whole. The results from this survey in 2016 show high scores on average. A gap analysis is also made in order to strengthen the subsidiaries where the score is low. The score in 2016 was on average 2,86 where 3 is highest. No subsidiary within the group have scored lower than 2. Our target is to have an average score higher than 2.5 and that no subsidiary should have score lower than 2.

CSR REPORT 2016 

 

 

CEO STATEMENT 2016 

 

We are a proud member of UN Global Compact. A UN foundation of more than 9.200 
companies in 166 countries. Companies and organizations who will thrive through a joined 
effort, to improve the CSR efforts throughout the World. Across nationalities, cultures, 
religions and order interests.  

At Ball Group we continue our efforts to improve the principals of UN Global Compact 
within our own organization, as well as in close collaboration with our partners worldwide. 
We work to obtain better conditions for human and labor rights, improving environmental 
and animal welfare. 

Furthermore, Ball Group welcomes UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’S) program 
as an aspiration for improving our world.  

Ball Group went through a landmark year in 2016. A substantial part of our activities was 
divested at the beginning of the year, this to obtain focus on our core business the Curvy 
Fashion segment. 

This resulting in a long line of changes and adjustments within our organization. Throughout 
this year of changes, we have kept our employees well-being at the center or our 
concern, thus our CSR-focus have been pinpointed on internal employees working 
conditions.  

We meet 2017 in strong faith for the future. For ourselves and our partners, and we are 
looking forward to being a part of the UN Global Compact for another year.

1. COMPANY PRESENTATION 

BALL Group was founded in 1988. The primary idea was to provide fashionable clothing at 

reasonable prices while relying on strong business acumen. This was the beginning of the 

business  concept  as  we  know  it  today.  BALL  GROUP  stays  true  to  this  concept,  but  the 

targeted customer segment has been broadened. 

• 

 2000 – In August, the brand Zizzi arose from a desire to offer fashion clothes for the 

so-called  curvy  fashion  segment  (size  42-56).  Zizzi  became  an  immediate  success 

and  the  concept  has  since  been  elaborated  on  with  a  well-established  store 

concept.  

•  2004 – In August, the brand Culture were established with its first collection 
•  2007 – In August, PULZ Jeans were launched.  
•  2014 – In August, Educe were launched 
•  2016 – In January Ball Group divests all Regular Size brands  

Today, BALL-GROUP stands strong in its main segment: 

Curvy Fashion (size 42 to 56) 

•  ZIZZI  CONCEPT  currently  holds  a  total  of  approx.  115  stores  located  in  Denmark, 

Norway, Sweden, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands and Estonia. 1/3 of these stores 

are operated by franchisees. Zizzi is also sold in leading multi-brand stores in Denmark, 

Norway,  Sweden,  Germany,  The  Netherlands,  Finland,  England,  Iceland,  France, 

Belgium, Austria, Italy and The Czech Republic. 

 

BALL  GROUP  is  today  known  as  a  company  that  continuously  delivers  the  latest  trends, 

where service, flexibility, business acumen and ""value for the money"" are key aspects. With 

our current position in the curvy fashion segment, we are thus well equipped to continuously 

expand this exciting and ambitious company.

2. CSR APPORACH 

2.1 CSR COMMITTEE 

CSR  has  always  been  a  natural  part  of  BALL  GROUP’s  business  approach,  rooting  in  the 

general maxim that you should treat others as you yourself would like to be treated. The CSR 

Committee is headed by Rikke Knudsen (Business Developer) and further consisting of Kuno 

Kildetoft Mehlsen (Chief Executive Officer). 

The  Committee  continues  to  convene,  initiating  short-term  and  long-term  actions  and 

defining goals to pursue. In the following, BALL GROUP’s overall CSR policy in terms of the 

Code of Conduct, together with the activities initiated and undertaken from January 2016 

to December 2016 is being presented.  

 

2.2 CODE OF CONDUCT 

BALL GROUP’s Code of Conduct describes the core values, ethical principles and behaviour 

that  BALL  GROUP  wishes  to  promote  throughout  the  supply  chain. It  incorporates  Global 

Compact’s 10 principles and one additional animal welfare principle.   

The Code of Conduct is an integrated part of BALL GROUPs supplier manual and our overall 

CSR policy, which all suppliers with their signature have warranted to commit to and comply 

with.  

BALL GROUP’s Code of Conduct is based on UN Global Compact’s 10 principles and sets 

additional requirements. In the following the key points of our Code of Conduct is being 

presented. We do not release our detailed Code of Conduct.  

 

 

 

 

6 

1. Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human 

rights 

BALL GROUP respects and supports initiatives to promote internationally declared human 

rights and condemns violation of these. Suppliers warrant to support and not violate such 

rights.  

2. Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses 

Suppliers shall seek to prevent or lessen adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked 

to their business, even if they have not contributed to those impacts.  

3. Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the 

right to collective bargaining 

Suppliers  will  acknowledge  and  protect  the  right  to  organize  and  collective  bargaining, 

freedom of association and freedom of opinion and expression. Suppliers will allow these 

rights, will not interfere with worker’s union and will not prevent workers from joining these 

unions.  

4. Business should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour 

Suppliers must not use any kind of forced or prison labour.   

5. Business should uphold the effective abolition of child labour 

Child  labour  is  defined  as  employment  of  children  under  a  certain  age  at  regular  and 

sustained labour. The age shall be determined according to local laws and societal norms 

while  at  the  same  time  following  the  UN  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  that 

“recognizes  the  right  of  the  child  to  be  protected  from  economic  exploitation  and  from 

performing any work that id likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, 

or  to  be  harmful  to  the  child’s  health  or  physical,  mental,  spiritual,  moral  or  social 

development.” (Article 32) 

6. Business should uphold the elimination or discrimination in respect of employment and 

occupation 

Employees shall not be subjected to discrimination regarding race, colour, caste nationality, 

religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, trade union membership, 

 

7 

political affiliation or personal opinion at any time during recruitment, during employment 

or after termination of the working contract. 

7. Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges 

Suppliers warrant that national environmental laws and regulations are complied with at all 

times.  

8. Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility 

All  chemicals  and  hazardous  materials  must  be  safely  handled,  stored,  transported  and 

disposed of according to local law.  

Water should be used responsibly. This includes reducing water use and implementing water 

recycling as much as possible. Suppliers must treat and dispose of wastewater according 

to local law.  

Suppliers should work to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas. All emissions that 

are produced during production must be monitored, controlled and treated as required by 

local law.  

9.  Business  should  encourage  the  development  and  diffusion  of  environmentally  friendly 

technologies 

Suppliers  must  follow  and  comply  with  BALL  GROUP’s  chemical  content  restrictions.  They 

warrant  that  all  delivered  goods  comply  with  EC  regulations  as  to  chemical  contents 

allowed.  

Suppliers shall work to improve resource efficiency e.g. by implementing cleaner production 

techniques and reduce waste during production processes.   

10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery 

Suppliers  should  display  the  highest  level  of  ethical  integrity  when  dealing  with  workers, 

subcontractors1,  second  tier  suppliers2  and  BALL  GROUP  employees.  They  should  work 

against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.  

                                                            
1 A subcontractor is doing (part of) the work that the first tier supplier has agreed to do for BALL GROUP. 
2 A second tier supplier (referencing BALL GROUP) is a supplier that invoices the first-tier supplier for goods and 
services rendered.  

 

8 

Any  monetary  incentive  or  encouragement  of  BALL  GROUP  employees  is  prohibited. 

Furthermore,  BALL  GROUP  personnel  are  not  permitted  to  accept  gifts  of  greater  value 

except in case of special anniversaries, weddings, etc.  

11. Animals should be treated humanely according to animal welfare laws and international 

recommendations 

In  businesses  where  animals  are  used  in  labour  and/or  in  the  production  (fur,  wool,  etc.) 

such  animals  must  be  fed  and  treated  with  dignity  and  respect,  and  no  animal  must 

deliberately be harmed nor exposed to pain in their lifespan. Taking the lives of animals must 

at all times be conducted by using the quickest, least painful and non-traumatic method 

available, approved by national and acknowledged veterinarians and only conducted by 

trained personnel.  

Suppliers will seek to increase traceability in production – in particular regarding the origin 

of the individual animal – and will thus increase awareness of animal welfare.  

 

3. CSR ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS 

3.1. CHEMICAL TESTING 

Last  year’s  research  among  our  suppliers  showed,  the  environmental  aspect  is  the  area 

lacking  focus  the  most.  We  are  fully  aware,  and  acknowledge,  that  BALL  GROUP  as  a 

company has limited power and control in relation to our supplier and the entire CSR aspect 

of the fashion industry. We do though truly believe that small steps in the right direction are 

more valuable for the entire industry, than deadlock and disregard. 

A chemical testing programme was launched in 2014 and is still being followed. We have 

entered a cooperation with Bureau Veritas, who has labs in all our sourcing countries. We 

have decided to follow a random sampling method, in order to get a better insight to the 

subject  among  our  suppliers.  By  following  a  random  sampling  method,  we  are  better 

ensured  that  all  suppliers  and  types  of  style  have  equal  chances  of  being  selected  for 

testing. Our testing programme is based on the requirements in REACH (hereunder covering 

the candidate list of substances of very high concern).  

 

9 

Moreover we have entered a network for the Danish fashion industry, which primary focus 

is knowledge sharing in regards to reducing chemicals in production. The network meets 4 

times  a  year,  discussing  various  issues,  REACH  and  methods  for  reducing  the  risk  of 

chemicals in our products.   

We  have  updated  our  supplier  manual  in  relation  to  chemical  testing,  ensuring  that  all 

suppliers are informed about our increased focus on this area, and collected their warranty 

to this subject.  

The performance in chemical tests has been included as a part of our overall evaluation of 

each supplier. We have a performance scheme in which each supplier is evaluated in terms 

of  different  factors  of  quality.  Chemical  testing  is  now  an  added  factor  in  quality 

performance.  

The chemical testing programme is now a permanent part of our CSR activities, and the 

work in this field will therefore continue in 2016. The random sampling method will be our 

guiding  approach,  but  with  flexibility  in  relation  to  possible  concerns  in  the  buying 

departments on high risk fabrics and decorations. 

 

3.2 HUMAN RIGHTS 

The buying departments in BALL GROUP are frequently visiting our suppliers in all sourcing 

countries. Part of the purpose with these visits, is to keep close relations and be in a constant 

dialogue with our suppliers, regarding optimization of relevant CSR areas. As stated in our 

Code of Conduct, human rights is a very important case for BALL GROUP, and the visits at 

our suppliers is always including extra control and observations, to ensure that human rights 

always  are  being  fully  respected.  As  our  research  from  2013  revealed,  infringements  of 

human rights is not an issue among our suppliers, and we are pleased to  ascertain that our 

own  observations  shows  that  our  supplier  are  treating  their  employees  respectfully,  and 

within the scope of our Code of Conduct. Frequently supplier visits in our sourcing countries, 

will be a continuing part of our CSR activities in 2016. 

 

 

10 

3.3 ANIMAL WELFARE 

As noticed in the CSR report for 2013, all fur was excluded from the collections from 2014. 

The  present  year  has  thereby  been  the  thrid  year  without  any  fur  in  the  collections.  We 

continue  to  hold  stand  on  this  decision,  until  better  methods  for  traceability  of  fur  is 

implemented in the industry. 

 

3.4 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 

BALL  GROUP  has  increased  the  production  in  countries  closer  to  Denmark,  as  well  as  a 

constant  focus  on  preferring  to  transport  our  products  to  Denmark  via  cargo  ships, 

compared to air freights. Both of these initiatives are supporting our focus on reducing our 

Co2 emission.  

A warehouse system has been implemented in 2014. The new system will have a positive 

impact on the environment, as our warehouse now is able to pack up higher volume in the 

boxes, compared to earlier.  We are thereby expecting to reduce our Co2 emission, as our 

frequency  of  delivery  will  be  reduced.  Moreover,  we  have  begun  to  re-use  boxes  for 

shipping, if the boxes was not damaged after the first transport. 

Further, we have increased focus on recycling cardboard/plastic and paper. 

In 2014 we have started to collect and sort used plastic bottles and cans, in our canteen. 

Two  large  boxes  for  sorting  has  been  installed.  We  are  thereby  ensuring  the  recycling  of 

bottles and cans, instead of the previously destruction.

3.4 CERTIFIED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS 

BALL  GROUP  has  spent  the  last  two  years  on  mapping  our  suppliers  according  to 

compliance with the BSCI (or similar) standards.

BALL GROUP aims to improve the numbers certified suppliers the coming years. 

We do acknowledge that a 100% of BSCI certified suppliers is preferred, but we also believe 

that productions facilities are at different stages in the development process, and that our 

influence  can  be  applied  positively,  by  supporting  less  developed  suppliers  in  the 

improvement process, compared to cutting the cooperation and leaving the suppliers at a 

negative plateau.

4.1. THE UNDER-REPRESENTED GENDER 
One  of  the  bearing  beams  of  the  UN  Global  Compact  is  the  wish  for  equality  across 

genders, races and religions. As noticed in the CSR report from 2013, the board decided in 

March 2013 to establish a target for underrepresented gender in the top management. The 

following target was agreed upon, and is still valid: 

“20% of the top management in Ball Group seeks to consist of female’s pr. 2017, which also 

include a minimum of 1 female board member.”  

Furthermore, the top management developed a policy for increasing the amount of the 

underrepresented gender in other management bodies. The following policy was enforced: 

 

12 

“One  of  the  bearing  beams  in  the  UN  Global  Compact  is  the  wish  for  equality  across 

genders,  races  and  religions.  We  have  integrated  this  on  our  recruitment  policy,  so  that 

professional and social competencies solely are being used as basis of evaluation. Everyone 

is  thereby  guaranteed  equal  and  open  possibilities  for  being  a  part  of  Ball  Group,  and 

hereafter making use of own possibilities and competencies in the best possible way. The 

above mentioned basis of evaluation will likewise be used in connection with recruitment 

for open positions in Ball Group’s top management.”   

Due to the divestment of the Regular Size Segment and subsequent reconstruction of the 

top  Management,  the  Executive  board  has  only  passed  one  male  member  in  2016.  

From the beginning of 2017 the Executive Board will be extended with two new members – 

one of each gender. 

Furthermore,  a  female  board  member  has  been  inserted  in  a  number  of  the  group’s 

subsidiaries in 2016. 

 

4.2 TRAINEES 

BALL GROUP wishes to support young people in their aim for education. Currently we have 

3  employees  following  a  trainee  programme  in  the  marketing  and  finance  department, 

respectively.  

BALL GROUP expects to continue the support of new trainees in the future.

4.3 WORKING CONDITIONS 
2016 has been a landmark year for Ball Group. 

A large group of employees was transferred to the a new employer, due the divestment of 

Regular Size segment. 

Furthermore we have been forced to lay off a number of good and loyal employees in our 

Shared Service Department, in order to adapt our organization to the remaining business. 

All laid-off colleagues have been offered an outplacement course, as a result, more than 

90% has been offered new jobs outside Ball Group. 

Figure 2 illustrate that we are a company under reconstructing, that mostly attracts women 

– due to our position in women’s fashion industry.

As a part of reconstructing our Business 34 new employees have joined the BALL GROUP 

organization in 2016 (figure 2). 

In 2016 we had 6 female and 3 male employees on maternity leave. We are very happy 

that everything has gone well for our employees and that healthy children were born.

The absence due to illness in the period from 2013 to 2016 shows a decrease from 3.3. % in 

2013 till 1,9% in 2016 (figure 3). It is a very positive development, and we perceive it as a 

reflection of the highly satisfactory results from employees’ satisfaction survey in 2015.   At 

BALL  GROUP  we  take  pride  in  the  fact  that  our  employees  are  happy,  healthy  and 

motivated. We believe that it should be fun, instructive, safe and satisfying to be at work. 

We also believe that certain diversity in gender, age, education, attitude and outlook on 

life creates a good and prosperous work environment. 

BALL GROUP offers all employees a pension and health care scheme. For a small monthly 

fee there is free access to tea, coffee, water, fruits and luncheon – consisting of a warm 

dish, bread and a salad bar. The food is being delivered from an external caterer that has 

in  the  course  fully  implemented  a  healthy  lifestyle  approach.  Beyond  that,  we  continue 

substituting the majority of sodas, candy, chocolate and other sugary treats with water and 

fruits. 

Furthermore, a massage therapist offers her services during work hours three to four times a 

month. The treated employees receive full payment for the duration of the treatment. 

5. OBJECTIVE FOR 2017 

BSCI CERTIFICATION 

The  objective  for  2017  in  the  CSR  field  is  to  increase  the  number  of  suppliers  with  BSCI 

certification. 

We believe that CSR is a common and cooperative task, which should be improved with a 

joined  effort  from  BALL  GROUP  and  our  suppliers.  By  aiming  for  a  higher  number  of  BSCI 

certificated suppliers, we are stimulating the motivation for improvement within all areas of 

 

15 

UN  Global  Compact.  We  will  undertake  a  new  survey  among  our  current  suppliers,  for 

revealing the increase in the number of BSCI certificated production plants.  

By  focusing  on  supporting  our  suppliers  in  the  aim for  BSCI certification  we are attacking 

several parts of the CSR field at one. Moreover it will provide us with an even greater insight 

to the weak points at the facilities of each supplier. By getting more information about the 

weak areas, we are better prepared for supporting each supplier in the needed fields.  

CHEMICAL TESTING 

A chemical testing programme was launched in 2014 and is still being followed. 

As we acknowledge we are somewhat short of being “Best-in-class” within chemical testing. 

We have a declared target to improve our number of tested styles with no less than 20 % 

within 2017. 

6. CONCLUSION 

Due  to  the  major  organizational  changes  and  reconstruction  of  business  after  the 

divestment of the Regular Size segment, our main focus in 2016, has been on the internal 

working conditions in Ball Group.  

It has been of great importance for us, to help the redundant staff members further along 

with  their  working  lives,  and  we  have  placed  great  emphasis  on  creating  a  secure 

workplace for the remaining colleagues. 

After a year with internal focus, our focus for 2017 will once again be on certification of our 
suppliers, and we aim to improve the numbers certified suppliers the coming years. 

Furthermore, we continue to put a special attention towards the use of chemicals in the 
production, and we are very pleased that suppliers have adapted to these goals.

This resulting in a long line of changes and adjustments within our organization. Throughout this year of changes, we have kept our employees well-being at the center or our concern, thus our CSR-focus have been pinpointed on internal employees working We meet 2017 in strong faith for the future.

The primary idea was to provide fashionable clothing at reasonable prices while relying on strong business acumen. This was the beginning of the business  concept  as  we  know  it  today.  BALL  GROUP  stays  true  to  this  concept,  but  the targeted customer segment has been broadened. •  2000 – In August, the brand Zizzi arose from a desire to offer fashion clothes for the and  the  concept  has  since  been  elaborated  on  with  a  well-established  store •  2004 – In August, the brand Culture were established with its first collection •  2007 – In August, PULZ Jeans were launched.  •  2014 – In August, Educe were launched •  2016 – In January Ball Group divests all Regular Size brands  Today, BALL-GROUP stands strong in its main segment: Curvy Fashion (size 42 to 56) •  ZIZZI  CONCEPT  currently  holds  a  total  of  approx.  115  stores  located  in  Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands and Estonia. 1/3 of these stores are operated by franchisees. Zizzi is also sold in leading multi-brand stores in Denmark, Norway,  Sweden,  Germany,  The  Netherlands,  Finland,  England,  Iceland,  France, Belgium, Austria, Italy and The Czech Republic.  BALL  GROUP  is  today  known  as  a  company  that  continuously  delivers  the  latest  trends, where service, flexibility, business acumen and ""value for the money"" are key aspects. With our current position in the curvy fashion segment, we are thus well equipped to continuously expand this exciting and ambitious company.     4 We  exist  to  design,  source  and  market  fast-moving  fashion  products  for  the international plus-size women from size 42-56. Our  vision  is  to  be  true  and  inspiring  leaders,  providing  plus-size  women  with  equal opportunities when it comes to fashion and impassionate understanding, when it comes to service.  The following core values represent the foundation of BALL GROUP’s success, and mirrors all aspects of our businesses, hereunder also our approach to the CSR field: Customer focus  We  value  our  customers  and  want  to  build  long-lasting  relationships  based  on  great products and impassioned customer service.  We know them personally, pay attention to their needs and aim to give them more than they expect. Team spirit We value team spirit and the strength of common dreams and shared ambitions. Our  team  members  are  personally  accountable  for  making  the  team  stronger,  through dedication, sincerity and positive thinking in their daily interactions. Profit We value profit and salute the accomplishments that drive the profits of our business. We  acknowledge  profit  as  being  fundamental  to  our  existence  and  to  our  future opportunities and as a source of pride in having achieved what we set out to do  5 2.1 CSR COMMITTEE CSR  has  always  been  a  natural  part  of  BALL  GROUP’s  business  approach,  rooting  in  the general maxim that you should treat others as you yourself would like to be treated. The CSR Committee is headed by Rikke Knudsen (Business Developer) and further consisting of Kuno Kildetoft Mehlsen (Chief Executive Officer). The  Committee  continues  to  convene,  initiating  short-term  and  long-term  actions  and defining goals to pursue. In the following, BALL GROUP’s overall CSR policy in terms of the Code of Conduct, together with the activities initiated and undertaken from January 2016 to December 2016 is being presented.   2.2 CODE OF CONDUCT BALL GROUP’s Code of Conduct describes the core values, ethical principles and behaviour that  BALL  GROUP  wishes  to  promote  throughout  the  supply  chain. It  incorporates  Global Compact’s 10 principles and one additional animal welfare principle.   The Code of Conduct is an integrated part of BALL GROUPs supplier manual and our overall CSR policy, which all suppliers with their signature have warranted to commit to and comply with.  BALL GROUP’s Code of Conduct is based on UN Global Compact’s 10 principles and sets additional requirements. In the following the key points of our Code of Conduct is being presented. We do not release our detailed Code of Conduct.      6 1. Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights BALL GROUP respects and supports initiatives to promote internationally declared human rights and condemns violation of these. Suppliers warrant to support and not violate such rights.  2. Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Suppliers shall seek to prevent or lessen adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their business, even if they have not contributed to those impacts.  3. Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Suppliers  will  acknowledge  and  protect  the  right  to  organize  and  collective  bargaining, freedom of association and freedom of opinion and expression. Suppliers will allow these rights, will not interfere with worker’s union and will not prevent workers from joining these 4. Business should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Suppliers must not use any kind of forced or prison labour.   5. Business should uphold the effective abolition of child labour Child  labour  is  defined  as  employment  of  children  under  a  certain  age  at  regular  and sustained labour. The age shall be determined according to local laws and societal norms while  at  the  same  time  following  the  UN  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  that “recognizes  the  right  of  the  child  to  be  protected  from  economic  exploitation  and  from performing any work that id likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or  to  be  harmful  to  the  child’s  health  or  physical,  mental,  spiritual,  moral  or  social 6. Business should uphold the elimination or discrimination in respect of employment and Employees shall not be subjected to discrimination regarding race, colour, caste nationality, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, trade union membership,  7 political affiliation or personal opinion at any time during recruitment, during employment or after termination of the working contract. 7. Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Suppliers warrant that national environmental laws and regulations are complied with at all 8. Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility All  chemicals  and  hazardous  materials  must  be  safely  handled,  stored,  transported  and disposed of according to local law.  Water should be used responsibly. This includes reducing water use and implementing water recycling as much as possible. Suppliers must treat and dispose of wastewater according to local law.  Suppliers should work to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas. All emissions that are produced during production must be monitored, controlled and treated as required by 9.  Business  should  encourage  the  development  and  diffusion  of  environmentally  friendly Suppliers  must  follow  and  comply  with  BALL  GROUP’s  chemical  content  restrictions.  They warrant  that  all  delivered  goods  comply  with  EC  regulations  as  to  chemical  contents allowed.  Suppliers shall work to improve resource efficiency e.g. by implementing cleaner production techniques and reduce waste during production processes.   10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Suppliers  should  display  the  highest  level  of  ethical  integrity  when  dealing  with  workers, subcontractors1,  second  tier  suppliers2  and  BALL  GROUP  employees.  They  should  work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.                                                              1 A subcontractor is doing (part of) the work that the first tier supplier has agreed to do for BALL GROUP. 2 A second tier supplier (referencing BALL GROUP) is a supplier that invoices the first-tier supplier for goods and  8 Any  monetary  incentive  or  encouragement  of  BALL  GROUP  employees  is  prohibited. Furthermore,  BALL  GROUP  personnel  are  not  permitted  to  accept  gifts  of  greater  value except in case of special anniversaries, weddings, etc.  11. Animals should be treated humanely according to animal welfare laws and international In  businesses  where  animals  are  used  in  labour  and/or  in  the  production  (fur,  wool,  etc.) such  animals  must  be  fed  and  treated  with  dignity  and  respect,  and  no  animal  must deliberately be harmed nor exposed to pain in their lifespan. Taking the lives of animals must at all times be conducted by using the quickest, least painful and non-traumatic method available, approved by national and acknowledged veterinarians and only conducted by Suppliers will seek to increase traceability in production – in particular regarding the origin of the individual animal – and will thus increase awareness of animal welfare.   3. CSR ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS Last  year’s  research  among  our  suppliers  showed,  the  environmental  aspect  is  the  area lacking  focus  the  most.  We  are  fully  aware,  and  acknowledge,  that  BALL  GROUP  as  a company has limited power and control in relation to our supplier and the entire CSR aspect of the fashion industry. We do though truly believe that small steps in the right direction are more valuable for the entire industry, than deadlock and disregard. A chemical testing programme was launched in 2014 and is still being followed. We have entered a cooperation with Bureau Veritas, who has labs in all our sourcing countries. We have decided to follow a random sampling method, in order to get a better insight to the subject  among  our  suppliers.  By  following  a  random  sampling  method,  we  are  better ensured  that  all  suppliers  and  types  of  style  have  equal  chances  of  being  selected  for testing. Our testing programme is based on the requirements in REACH (hereunder covering the candidate list of substances of very high concern).   9 Moreover we have entered a network for the Danish fashion industry, which primary focus is knowledge sharing in regards to reducing chemicals in production. The network meets 4 times  a  year,  discussing  various  issues,  REACH  and  methods  for  reducing  the  risk  of chemicals in our products.   We  have  updated  our  supplier  manual  in  relation  to  chemical  testing,  ensuring  that  all suppliers are informed about our increased focus on this area, and collected their warranty to this subject.  The performance in chemical tests has been included as a part of our overall evaluation of each supplier. We have a performance scheme in which each supplier is evaluated in terms of  different  factors  of  quality.  Chemical  testing  is  now  an  added  factor  in  quality performance.  The chemical testing programme is now a permanent part of our CSR activities, and the work in this field will therefore continue in 2016. The random sampling method will be our guiding  approach,  but  with  flexibility  in  relation  to  possible  concerns  in  the  buying departments on high risk fabrics and decorations.  The buying departments in BALL GROUP are frequently visiting our suppliers in all sourcing countries. Part of the purpose with these visits, is to keep close relations and be in a constant dialogue with our suppliers, regarding optimization of relevant CSR areas. As stated in our Code of Conduct, human rights is a very important case for BALL GROUP, and the visits at our suppliers is always including extra control and observations, to ensure that human rights always  are  being  fully  respected.  As  our  research  from  2013  revealed,  infringements  of human rights is not an issue among our suppliers, and we are pleased to  ascertain that our own  observations  shows  that  our  supplier  are  treating  their  employees  respectfully,  and within the scope of our Code of Conduct. Frequently supplier visits in our sourcing countries, will be a continuing part of our CSR activities in 2016.   10 3.3 ANIMAL WELFARE As noticed in the CSR report for 2013, all fur was excluded from the collections from 2014. The  present  year  has  thereby  been  the  thrid  year  without  any  fur  in  the  collections.  We continue  to  hold  stand  on  this  decision,  until  better  methods  for  traceability  of  fur  is implemented in the industry.  BALL  GROUP  has  increased  the  production  in  countries  closer  to  Denmark,  as  well  as  a constant  focus  on  preferring  to  transport  our  products  to  Denmark  via  cargo  ships, compared to air freights. Both of these initiatives are supporting our focus on reducing our A warehouse system has been implemented in 2014. The new system will have a positive impact on the environment, as our warehouse now is able to pack up higher volume in the boxes, compared to earlier.

THE UNDER-REPRESENTED GENDER One  of  the  bearing  beams  of  the  UN  Global  Compact  is  the  wish  for  equality  across genders, races and religions.

Moreover it will provide us with an even greater insight to the weak points at the facilities of each supplier. By getting more information about the weak areas, we are better prepared for supporting each supplier in the needed fields.  A chemical testing programme was launched in 2014 and is still being followed. As we acknowledge we are somewhat short of being “Best-in-class” within chemical testing. We have a declared target to improve our number of tested styles with no less than 20 % within 2017. Due  to  the  major  organizational  changes  and  reconstruction  of  business  after  the divestment of the Regular Size segment, our main focus in 2016, has been on the internal working conditions in Ball Group.  It has been of great importance for us, to help the redundant staff members further along with  their  working  lives,  and  we  have  placed  great  emphasis  on  creating  a  secure workplace for the remaining colleagues. After a year with internal focus, our focus for 2017 will once again be on certification of our suppliers, and we aim to improve the numbers certified suppliers the coming years. Furthermore, we continue to put a special attention towards the use of chemicals in the production, and we are very pleased that suppliers have adapted to these goals.   16 "
